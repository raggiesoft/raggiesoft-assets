"""
Architectural Block: paige.py
===================================
This script ("Paige") acts as the primary manuscript processor, ingesting raw narrative 
files (.docx or .md) and converting them into structured JSON required by 'The Stardust Engine'.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Orchestration: Discover and traverse book directories based on conventions.
2. Frontmatter Extraction: Parse YAML-style metadata headers from chapters.
3. Slugification: Standardize folder and file names into URL-safe strings.
4. Error Handling & Safety: Incorporates trauma-informed UX ("Safety Protocol") to 
   provide gentle, reassuring console feedback during operations.

Maintenance Notes:
- Currently, the deep parsing logic for full text, smart quotes, and image references 
  is stubbed/delegated. When expanding `process_book`, ensure it handles encoding safely.
- Directory traversal relies on alphabetical sorting to determine book/part/chapter order.
  Ensure source directories follow numeric prefixing (e.g., `01-Title`).

# --- PAIGE: THE LITERARY EDITOR (v6) ---
# "I am Michael's sister. I process his books, and I keep him safe."
#
# PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:
# Paige ingests raw manuscripts (.docx or .md) and compiles them into the 
# structured JSON format required by 'The Stardust Engine' reader.
#
# SECONDARY DIRECTIVE (SAFETY PROTOCOL):
# Paige is designated as Michael's "Safe Person." 
# If execution complexity spikes or the workflow becomes overwhelming, 
# Paige initiates "Deep Pressure Protocol": 
# She stands close, offers grounding hugs, and remains by his side 
# until regulation is achieved. She does not leave.
