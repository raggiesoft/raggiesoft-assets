**LORE NOTE:**
The album's powerful "before" picture. This two-part anthem opens with a heartfelt 80s power ballad capturing Leo's profound sense of safety and contentment with his "three guiding stars"—his sisters, Stella and Luna, and his best friend, Olivia.

The song then explodes into a triumphant rock track, representing his boundless, naive optimism for the future. This is the sound of his complete, happy, and authentic self—the world that is about to be shattered by the events to come.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The college books are open wide
With my whole world right by my side
A quiet laugh, a knowing look
A chapter from a favorite book
The future's just a distant shore
I couldn't ask for anything more
Than this small room, this gentle space
A perfect time, a perfect place

[Chorus]
And I've got my three guiding stars
Healing all my childhood scars
A sister's strength, a sister's grace
A best friend's warm and kind embrace
This is the only life I need
A perfect, rare, and precious creed
Yeah, I'm nineteen and invincible
With a love that's unconditional

[Verse 2]
We talk for hours on the phone
I never feel like I'm alone
You get the jokes inside my head
On every single word unsaid
We're just a team of misfit souls
Making each other brave and whole
No need to search, no need to roam
'Cause with the three of you, I'm home

[Intro]
(A powerful, triumphant 80s rock drum fill kicks in, and the song explodes with driving electric guitars and a soaring synthesizer melody.)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, the world is out there, big and wide
But I've got nothing left to hide
With my team right here, my crew, my friends
The story never has to end
We're gonna chase the summer sun
Our real adventure's just begun
Got a full tank and a radio
And everywhere is ours to go!

[Chorus]
And I feel the rhythm, I feel the beat
Of my own heart on a crowded street
We're coming back to the kids we knew
In shades of brilliant white and blue
This is the sound of being free
This is the sound of being me!

[Guitar Solo]
(A soaring, melodic, and triumphant 80s rock guitar solo, full of emotion and a sense of release.)

[Chorus]
And I feel the rhythm, I feel the beat
Of my own heart on a crowded street
We're coming back to the kids we knew
In shades of brilliant white and blue
This is the sound of being free
This is the sound of being me!
