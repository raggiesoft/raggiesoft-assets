**LORE NOTE:**
An upbeat 80s rock anthem capturing Leo's naive excitement at meeting Delores (Vanessa). He is still reeling from his best friend Olivia moving away, and Delores feels like a hopeful new beginning.

However, a **prominent, worried flute melody** plays throughout the entire track, a stark contrast to the song's otherwise optimistic tone. This is Luna's "Playing the Flute" signal—her desperate, unheard warning to her brother that this new light is casting a very dark shadow.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The world felt gray, a missing piece
A quiet, slow, and sad release
A chapter closed, a best friend gone
Just trying to find a way to carry on
The days were long, the colors faded
A little lost and worn and jaded
Then you walked in and caught my eye
Beneath a dull community college sky

[Verse 2]
You talk of dreams and taking flight
Of leaving all the dark for light
You say you see the real me there
A kindred soul beyond compare
It feels so fast, it feels so right
A sudden star in my dark night
You fill the void, you bridge the gap
A perfect escape

[Chorus: Female Singer]
I see a new light in your lonely room
But there's a shadow chasing after you
You see a fast car on an open road
I see a heavy, heavy load
And for the first time in a long, long while...

[Chorus: Male Singer]
And you're a new light in a lonely room
Chasing away the coming gloom
You're a fast car on an open road
Lifting off a heavy load
And for the first time in a long, long while...

[Outro: Female Singer]
(Sung from Luna's perspective)
A new light...
Oh, my dear brother, please be smart
This new light's going to break your heart...
It's going to break your heart...
