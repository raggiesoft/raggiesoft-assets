**LORE NOTE:**
A multi-part epic that musically depicts Leo's primary survival mechanism: the **"Painted Smile."**

**1. The Mask:**
The "Painted Smile" is defined as a "hollow mask of endurance." It is not a genuine expression of happiness; it is a rigid, forced facade of compliance that Leo locks into place to hide his fear from Delores. It serves as a survival shield, protecting his "broken parts" from a predator who feeds on his emotional reactions.

**2. The Sonic Shift:**
The song begins as a gentle 80s power ballad, representing his authentic, safe self when he is with his sisters. As Delores's presence looms over the "Sibling Weekend," the track transitions into a tense, driving rock bridge. Finally, in the closing moments, the music violently shatters into a **cold, heavy industrial sound**. This sonic shift mimics the dissociation Leo experiences—becoming mechanical and silent to endure the trauma.

**3. The Narrative Arc:**
This track marks the moment the trap snaps shut. It establishes the psychological barrier Leo will live behind for the entirety of Disc 1. The mask will not fall until the track "Sanctuary" on Disc 2, when he is finally safe on his native ground.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
Just one more day, just one more night
Safe in this warm and gentle light
With you beside me, I can breathe
A quiet promise, I believe
This is my home, this is my peace
A fragile, temporary lease
On who I am, on who I'll be
Before the shadows come for me

[Verse 2]
An easy laugh, a gentle sound
On this familiar, sacred ground
No need to guess, no need to hide
With my true north right by my side
A steady hand, a knowing glance
A world away from happenstance
This is the truth I'm clinging to
My sanctuary here with you

[Bridge]
(The music begins to warp, the warm pads glitching into something sharper)
But I hear your footsteps in the hall
I see your shadow on the wall
The air gets thick, the silence screams
The end of all my fragile dreams
My heart begins to beat the drum
For the cold and silent man I must become

[Chorus]
(Music abruptly switches to a heavy, cold industrial beat)
And now the mask comes down
Just a face in a lonely town
The painted smile is in its place
Leaving not a single trace
Of the boy I was a breath ago
A secret no one else can know
The static's on, the silence starts
Protecting all my broken parts

[Outro]
(Industrial beat continues, relentless and mechanical)
The painted smile...
The static's on...
Can't let her see...
The fear in me...
The silence starts...
The silence starts...
