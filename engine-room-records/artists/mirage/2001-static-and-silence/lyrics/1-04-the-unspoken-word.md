**LORE NOTE:**
Luna sees Delores for exactly who she is—a predator isolating her prey. This song represents Luna's last, desperate attempt to warn Leo before he gets on the bus.

Throughout the track, a **prominent, searching flute melody** weaves through the mix. This is Luna frantically "Playing the Flute"—broadcasting their shared "Safe Harbor" code in a plea for him to wake up. The tragedy of the song is that while the signal is clear to the listener, it goes unheeded by Leo, who is already too deep in Delores's web to hear it.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
I see the mask come down again
A stranger where my friend has been
I feel the static start to rise
Behind the emptiness in your eyes
You're building walls of steel and stone
And I'm so scared you're all alone
I'm reaching out, a silent plea
Oh brother, please, come back to me

[Chorus]
(The music swells with a prominent, searching flute melody)
This is the unspoken word, the space between the lines
A desperate signal, a secret sign
More than a feeling, more than a touch
It's knowing that I miss you much
You're not alone, I'm not alone
On this dark path you've been thrown

[Verse 2]
He's standing there, a ghost in white
Stealing all your precious light
I see the future, dark and gray
As he prepares to take you away
I'm playing our song, a desperate prayer
To let you know that I am still there
The only way that I know how
To save you from this broken vow

[Chorus]
(The flute melody becomes more urgent and prominent)
This is the unspoken word, the space between the lines
A desperate signal, a secret sign
More than a feeling, more than a touch
It's knowing that I miss you much
You're not alone, I'm not alone
On this dark path you've been thrown

[Flute Solo]
(A poignant, searching, and deeply emotional flute solo, full of a desperate, pleading energy—Luna's final, unheard warning before the bus trip begins.)
