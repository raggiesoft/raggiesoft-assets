**LORE NOTE:**
An anxious, hypnotic instrumental that marks the beginning of the four-day bus trip from **Norfolk, Virginia**.

The music covers the initial, exhausting leg of the journey: the bus change in Richmond, the long haul through Charlottesville and Roanoke, and the crossing into Tennessee via Bristol and Knoxville.

The monotonous, driving beat and repetitive synth-bass mimic the endless highway and the vibration of the bus floor. This is the sound of the journey before Leo is consciously aware of the danger; he feels that something is fundamentally wrong with this "adventure," but he can't yet articulate the fear that is slowly building with every mile he travels further from home.

**LYRICS:**

[Soundscape Intro]
(The track opens with the sound of heavy, cold rain hitting pavement and the low, idling drone of a diesel bus engine. The sound of air brakes releasing signals the departure.)

[Verse Section - Instrumental]
(A heavy, distorted drum machine establishes a driving, monotonous rhythm at 115 BPM. A deep, pulsing synthesizer bass joins in, mimicking the relentless motion of the wheels.)

[Atmosphere]
(Sparse, clean electric guitar notes echo over the industrial beat, drenched in reverb to create a sense of vast, empty distance.)

[Bridge - Instrumental]
(The intensity builds. The clean guitar gives way to a raw, desperate, distorted solo that feels like a silent cry for help, buried under the mechanical noise of the engine.)

[Outro]
(The industrial beat continues, unyielding. The sound of distant city traffic and rain weaves back into the mix.)

[Transition]
(The music does not resolve. It ends with the sharp hiss of air brakes and the instrumental announcement of "Knoxville," flowing directly into the next track, "Nashville.")
