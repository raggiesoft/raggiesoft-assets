**LORE NOTE:**
The journey's ambient dread becomes a conscious, painful thought in the heart of Nashville. Surrounded by the sounds and dreams of Music City, Leo's internal monologue is one of pure regret and dawning horror. He realizes the trip is a terrible mistake and he is trapped.

He desperately wishes he could turn the bus around, but he lacks the strength to confront Delores.

**Crucial Context:** At *any* point during this trip, if Leo had contacted Stella or Luna in Virginia, or Olivia in Washington, they would have immediately worked together to extract him and bring him home. His isolation is self-imposed by fear, not by a lack of support.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The neon glows, a river deep
Promises this town can't keep
Another city, another sign
This ain't your journey, it's not mine
They're singing songs of love and truth
In every smoky, crowded booth
I see the dream, I see the fame
But all I feel is burning shame

[Chorus]
Oh, Nashville, what am I doing here?
Drowning in a sea of unspoken fear
Every mile's a chain, every town's a cell
Trapped inside this four-day hell
I wish that I could turn this bus around
But I'm westward, broken, and silence is the only sound

[Verse 2]
She's staring out the window pane
At her own world of sun and rain
She doesn't see I'm miles away
Or hear the words I'll never say
Just a body in a seat
Heading down a dead-end street
A piece of luggage that she brings
With broken hopes and broken wings

[Chorus]
Oh, Nashville, what am I doing here?
Drowning in a sea of unspoken fear
Every mile's a chain, every town's a cell
Trapped inside this four-day hell
I wish that I could turn this bus around
But I'm westward, broken, and silence is the only sound

[Instrumental Bridge]
(A lonesome, melancholic slide guitar solo plays over the industrial beat, sounding like a country song from a distant, broken radio.)

[Chorus]
Oh, Nashville, what am I doing here?
Drowning in a sea of unspoken fear
Every mile's a chain, every town's a cell
Trapped inside this four-day hell
I wish that I could turn this bus around
But I'm westward, broken, and silence is the only sound
