**LORE NOTE:**
A bleak and atmospheric industrial instrumental. The music captures the vast, empty landscape of the Great Plains and the desolate feeling of a windswept truck stop in **Colby, Kansas**.

This track represents a pivotal, silent moment during a daytime meal and restroom break. Leo watches Delores step away from the bus. She stands alone in the lot, facing **East**—back toward Virginia, back toward safety. For a fleeting second, her posture slumps, and her face shows a crack of genuine uncertainty. Is she having second thoughts? Is she realizing the magnitude of what she has done?

But as the music shifts from a lonesome drone to a harder, more rigid beat, her expression hardens. She turns her back on the East. She decides **NO**. They must press on. The moment of mercy passes, and she drags him back onto the bus, heading West.

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track is built on a very slow, sparse drum machine beat and a low, droning synthesizer bass note that represents the vast, empty landscape of the plains under the bright, indifferent sun.)

(A distant, heavily reverbed, and lonesome synthesizer whistle drifts in and out, like the wind cutting across the flatland.)

(A simple, high-register piano melody plays a few hesitant, uncertain notes—representing Delores's moment of doubt—before being swallowed by the returning, oppressive industrial drone as the bus engine roars back to life.)
