**LORE NOTE:**
The journey's physical toll begins in earnest in **Denver, Colorado**.

The industrial sound is now blended with a sparse, lonely acoustic guitar, reflecting the vast, cold emptiness of the mountains. The lyrics capture Leo's multiple layers of physical distress:
1.  **Altitude:** Already struggling with respiratory issues at sea level due to his disability, the thin air of the "Mile High City" leaves him gasping and dizzy.
2.  **The Sore:** A "secret fire" begins to burn—the first whisper of the pressure sore developing on his hip.
3.  **The Silence:** He is hungry, thirsty, and in pain, but he is too terrified to use his AAC device to tell Delores. He suffers in absolute silence, afraid that "making a fuss" will only make her angrier.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The air is thin, my head is tight
Beneath the sharp and western light
A ghost inside this diesel drone
A thousand miles, still all alone
The mountain peaks, a jagged crown
In this cold and mile-high town
Just want a drink, a piece of bread
But there's a voice inside my head

[Chorus]
A mile high, but I'm sinking low
A silent 'no' is all I know
My stomach's empty, throat is dry
Beneath a cold Colorado sky
And there's a whisper of a different pain
A secret fire, a burning stain
I can't say a word, she'll never see
The pieces that are breaking inside me

[Verse 2]
Another station, another crowd
Her angry sighs are getting loud
We change the bus, a hurried pace
No kindness in this bitter place
I watch the others, free to go
A life I'll never get to know
Just bite my tongue and play the part
And hide the panic in my heart

[Chorus]
A mile high, but I'm sinking low
A silent 'no' is all I know
My stomach's empty, throat is dry
Beneath a cold Colorado sky
And there's a whisper of a different pain
A secret fire, a burning stain
I can't say a word, she'll never see
The pieces that are breaking inside me

[Instrumental Bridge]
(The industrial beat continues, but it's overlaid with a distant, atmospheric, and slightly distorted acoustic guitar melody that feels vast and lonely, like the mountains.)

[Chorus]
A mile high, but I'm sinking low
A silent 'no' is all I know
My stomach's empty, throat is dry
Beneath a cold Colorado sky
And there's a whisper of a different pain
A secret fire, a burning stain
I can't say a word, she'll never see
The pieces that are breaking inside me
