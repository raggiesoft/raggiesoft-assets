**LORE NOTE:**
The physical and emotional horror deepens at the midnight bus change in **Salt Lake City, Utah** (Elevation: 4,265 ft).

The bus took the northern route (I-25 to US-287 to I-80), dragging them through the endless, high-altitude wind tunnels of **Wyoming**. While less steep than the Rockies, the relentless vibration of the bus across the Red Desert has wreaked havoc on Leo’s body. The "secret fire" is now a confirmed reality: a **Stage I pressure sore** is burning on his hip.

The tragedy of this moment is legal and personal. Under federal regulations, the bus operator **would have waited** for Leo to use the terminal restroom, as the onboard lavatory was inaccessible. But **Delores** convinces him there is "no time." She weaponizes his fear of being a burden, silencing him before he can advocate for himself, and rushes him onto the next coach like luggage.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
Midnight in a plastic chair
Breathing in the stale, dead air
A broken cracker, lukewarm drink
No time to rest, no time to think
The driver's waiting, knows my name
A single piece left in the game
I feel the ache, a steady thrum
To what new hell have I become?

[Chorus]
There's a fire burning on my skin
A secret war I'll never win
I try to show her where it hurts
She answers back with silent smirks
A roll of eyes, a heavy sigh
Just another pressure, another lie

[Verse 2]
She doesn't see, she doesn't care
Just leaves me sitting, sitting there
The clock is ticking on the wall
Before the final curtain call
I planned the stops, I made the calls
To get past stations, halls, and walls
A world prepared to help me through
But what good does it do with you?

[Chorus]
There's a fire burning on my skin
A secret war I'll never win
I try to show her where it hurts
She answers back with silent smirks
A roll of eyes, a heavy sigh
Just another pressure, another lie

[Instrumental Bridge]
(The industrial beat is overlaid with a clean, reverb-drenched electric guitar with heavy tremolo, playing a haunting, lonely, spaghetti-western-style melody, evoking the vast, empty desert surrounding the city.)

[Chorus]
There's a fire burning on my skin
A secret war I'll never win
I try to show her where it hurts
She answers back with silent smirks
A roll of eyes, a heavy sigh
Just another pressure, another lie
