**LORE NOTE:**
As the bus crosses into **Idaho**, the landscape shifts again, and Leo crosses an invisible line into the **Pacific Northwest**.

The journey stops briefly in **Boise** for a restroom break, then continues to **Nampa** for a quick passenger exchange. But for Leo, the geography is irrelevant compared to the psychological cage he is in.

The lyrics capture his deepening paranoia. As his pressure sore worsens and his isolation grows, he begins to see Delores not as his lover, but as his guard in a prison yard on wheels. He realizes she holds all the power—his wallet, his means of communication, his physical well-being.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The ache is deeper now, a steady beat
Stuck to this vinyl, sticky seat
The endless plains of brown and gray
Another piece of me slips away
The world outside is vast and dead
Matches the silence in my head
My body's screaming, needs a sign
Somewhere on this Idaho line

[Chorus]
Are you my lover, or are you my guard?
Is this a journey, or a prison yard?
There's a lock on the door, a bar on the sky
And I'm starting to see the truth behind the lie
A different kind of chill inside my soul
A creeping loss of all control

[Verse 2]
You hold the wallet, you hold the key
To every single part of me
I see you watching from your seat
Your victory feels so complete
This wasn't an adventure, not a game
You just needed someone else to blame
A trophy for your bitter prize
Reflected in your empty eyes

[Chorus]
Are you my lover, or are you my guard?
Is this a journey, or a prison yard?
There's a lock on the door, a bar on the sky
And I'm starting to see the truth behind the lie
A different kind of chill inside my soul
A creeping loss of all control

[Instrumental Bridge]
(A dark, moody, and slightly distorted harmonica solo plays over the industrial beat, sounding like a lonesome folk instrument lost in a cold, mechanical world.)

[Chorus]
Are you my lover, or are you my guard?
Is this a journey, or a prison yard?
There's a lock on the door, a bar on the sky
And I'm starting to see the truth behind the lie
A different kind of chill inside my soul
A creeping loss of all control

[Outro]
(Music fades with the beat and a final, lingering harmonica note)
My lover... or my guard...?
On the Idaho line...
