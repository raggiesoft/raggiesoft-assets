**LORE NOTE:**
A bleak, oppressive industrial instrumental for the final leg of the bus journey from Idaho to Washington.

The track is built on a slow, heavy, and relentless drum machine beat—like a funeral march—underscoring a dark, droning synthesizer. This sonic landscape represents the vast, empty desert outside the window and Leo's sense of impending doom.

He now knows the trip is a complete disaster. He wants to go home, but he is trapped in the psychological prison Delores has built around him. Over the heavy industrial drone, a high, thin, mournful synth melody plays—the sound of his fragile, fading hope as he braces himself for the nightmare he knows is coming.

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track opens with a slow, heavy drum machine beat at 70 BPM—relentless and dragging.)

(A very low, distorted synthesizer drone enters, providing a dark, monotonous foundation that mimics the passing desert landscape.)

(Over the oppressive low end, a high, thin, mournful synthesizer lead plays a simple, repeating, and almost broken-sounding melody. It sounds like a signal fading into the distance.)

(The track does not resolve; it simply fades out into a cold, hollow wind sound.)
