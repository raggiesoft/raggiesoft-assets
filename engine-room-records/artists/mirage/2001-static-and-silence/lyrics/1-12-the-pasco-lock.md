**LORE NOTE:**
A harsh and claustrophobic industrial rock track set in a locked family restroom in **Pasco, Washington**.

Leo, weakened by days of travel and the lack of medication, is physically unable to manage his own toileting needs. He is forced to rely on Delores for help. Instead of care, she gives him rage. The lyrics document his internal monologue as he endures her furious, screaming tirade while trapped in the small, tiled room.

The music is frantic and anxious, featuring a noisy, chaotic instrumental break that reflects his desperate desire to simply cease to exist—to be invisible, to crawl under a stone, to be anywhere but here. He is hungry, thirsty, humiliated, and utterly alone with her fury.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
White tiled walls and a buzzing light
A heavy door, locked up so tight
My body's weak, my needs are clear
But that's not why you brought me here
The hunger's gnawing, thirst is real
But all I'm ever forced to feel
Is the chilling echo in this space
And the rising fury on your face

[Chorus]
Just let me be invisible
Just let me crawl under a stone
Your voice is a razor, indivisible
Just leave me, leave me all alone
Inside this Pasco lock and key
There's no escape, no way to flee

[Verse 2]
And now the screaming finally starts
Tearing all my seams apart
It's all my fault, this whole cursed trip
The poison dripping from your lip
The walls are closing, tile and steel
This nightmare's finally getting real
You blame my chair, you blame my needs
You're planting bitter, hateful seeds

[Chorus]
Just let me be invisible
Just let me crawl under a stone
Your voice is a razor, indivisible
Just leave me, leave me all alone
Inside this Pasco lock and key
There's no escape, no way to flee

[Instrumental Bridge]
(A harsh, claustrophobic, and noisy industrial break. Chaotic, distorted synthesizer stabs clash over a frantic, heart-pounding drum machine beat. Buried low in the mix is a sound like a distorted, unintelligible scream.)

[Chorus]
Just let me be invisible
Just let me crawl under a stone
Your voice is a razor, indivisible
Just leave me, leave me all alone
Inside this Pasco lock and key
There's no escape, no way to flee
