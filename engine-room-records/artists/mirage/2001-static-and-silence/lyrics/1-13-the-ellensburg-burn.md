**LORE NOTE:**
A tense, simmering industrial instrumental set on the highway between **Pasco** and **Seattle**.

Following the verbal assault in "The Pasco Lock," Leo's internal state shifts. He no longer just fears Delores; he **hates** her. The trip, which she sold as a romantic reset, is revealed as a psychological prison he cannot escape.

The music is built on a tight, repetitive, militaristic drum loop representing Leo's forced, frantic attempt at self-regulation. A high-pitched, hissing synthesizer drone slowly builds in volume throughout the track—the sound of his anger burning like a fuse. With his trusted anchors (Stella and Luna) a continent away, his fear curdles into a cold, contained rage.

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track is built on a tight, repetitive, and almost militaristic drum machine loop at 120 BPM.)

(A low, distorted, and aggressive synthesizer bass line plays a simple, obsessive riff that never resolves.)

(A high-pitched, hissing synthesizer drone slowly builds in volume throughout the track, representing his simmering, contained anger.)

(There is no melody, only a single, repeated, angry synth stab that hits on the off-beat.)
