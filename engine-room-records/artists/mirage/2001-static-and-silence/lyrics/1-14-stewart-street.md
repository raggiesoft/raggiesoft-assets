**LORE NOTE:**
A slow, heavy, and oppressive industrial track with a **Grunge** influence, capturing Leo's cold dread upon arriving at the **Seattle** bus terminal (911 Stewart Street).

For Leo, Seattle isn't just a destination; it is a graveyard. The last time he was in this city (at King Street Station), he suffered the most severe autistic meltdown of his life—a catastrophic system crash triggered by saying goodbye to Olivia. Being back in this zip code reactivates that trauma instantly.

But the horror deepens. Standing in the cold rain with dead electronics, Leo overhears Delores on a payphone. He hears the "fake surprise" in her voice as she calls her aunt. He realizes the entire trip was a lie. He wasn't invited. He isn't an adventurer. He is a piece of luggage she dragged across the country to use as a prop. He is trapped, silenced, and thousands of miles from safety.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
Four days gone, the engine sighs
But there's no mercy in my eyes
My body screams it's morning light
In this cold and endless rush hour night
My screen is dark, my phone is dead
Just static roaring in my head
A stranger in a strange new town
As the evening rain comes pouring down

[Chorus]
And I hear the lie in your fake "Surprise!"
Reflected in the payphone's hollow eyes
You never told her we were on our way
You just decided you would stay
And now I know I'll never see
The home that's waiting back for me
This is the end, my final plea
Lost on this rainy Stewart Street

[Verse 2]
I hear you talk of "traffic jams"
Of "sudden trips" and altered plans
Your voice is sweet, a sugar shell
Hiding the keys to my new hell
The number one-five-oh you say
Another bus to take me away
Not closer home, but to the cage
You've built with your own bitter rage

[Chorus]
And I hear the lie in your fake "Surprise!"
Reflected in the payphone's hollow eyes
You never told her we were on our way
You just decided you would stay
And now I know I'll never see
The home that's waiting back for me
This is the end, my final plea
Lost on this rainy Stewart Street

[Instrumental Bridge]
(The industrial beat is joined by a heavily distorted, sludgy, and melancholic electric guitar solo, evoking a 90s Seattle grunge sound, but slowed to a desperate crawl.)

[Chorus]
And I hear the lie in your fake "Surprise!"
Reflected in the payphone's hollow eyes
You never told her we were on our way
You just decided you would stay
And now I know I'll never see
The home that's waiting back for me
This is the end, my final plea
Lost on this rainy Stewart Street
