**LORE NOTE:**
A dark, claustrophobic, and beatless industrial ambient track set in **Kent, Washington**.

The title comes from Delores's aunt, Carol Mahone, who cheerfully welcomes them to her home, calling it "A Slice of Heaven." To Leo, trapped in the guest room with no way to communicate his location to the outside world, it is "A Slice of Hell."

The music represents the oppressive, suffocating silence of the house. However, buried deep in the mix is a subtle, warmer texture—a shift in the drone. This represents **Carol's quiet observation**. Unlike Delores, she notices Leo's physical pain (the pressure sores) and his fear. She silently sides with him, sensing that her niece's story doesn't add up, though she does not yet speak out.

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track opens with no drum beat—only a low, oppressive, industrial drone that hums and pulses, representing the stuffy heat of the unwelcoming house.)

(A detuned, slightly off-key piano plays a sparse, repeating, and unsettling melody. It sounds like a warped lullaby.)

(The drone grows louder and more dissonant, creating a sense of intense physical discomfort and dread—the tense silence before the violent outburst that will happen the next morning.)
