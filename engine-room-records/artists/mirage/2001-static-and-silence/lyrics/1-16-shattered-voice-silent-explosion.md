**LORE NOTE:**
A short, violent, and jarring industrial instrumental that serves as the album's harrowing climax and the end of Disc 1.

It depicts the final confrontation in the guest room in **Kent, Washington**. Delores, enraged by Leo's silent request to go home (typed on his device), screams at him and physically rips the AAC machine from his hands. The track builds to a single, massive, distorted metallic **CRASH**—the sound of the device hitting the linoleum floor and shattering.

This is the "Death of the Voice." The crash is followed by a long, dead silence, the sound of freezing rain, and finally, the cold, mechanical click of the front door locking him out.

**Production Note:** The "Crash" sound effect was created by Julian Croft recording the sound of a vintage 1999 Quantum Communicator being dropped from a ladder in the studio.

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track begins with a chaotic, fast, and distorted drum machine loop at 160 BPM, overlaid with a frantic, dissonant synthesizer arpeggio that mimics the cadence of a screaming argument.)

(The noise builds to an unbearable crescendo, layering distortion upon distortion until—)

**[CRASH]**

(A single, massive, ear-splitting metallic impact. The music cuts out instantly.)

(Two seconds of absolute, dead silence.)

(The sound of cold, heavy rain begins to fade in, accompanied by a single, high-pitched, humming synthesizer note representing the ringing in Leo's ears.)

(The track ends with the heavy, final sound of a door slamming and the *click* of a deadbolt sliding home.)
