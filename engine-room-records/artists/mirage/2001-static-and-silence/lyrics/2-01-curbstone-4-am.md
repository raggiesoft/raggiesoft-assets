**LORE NOTE:**
The centerpiece of the album and the start of **Disc 2: The Journey Home**.

This is Leo's raw, unfiltered internal monologue immediately after Delores locks him out of the house in **Kent, Washington**. He is sitting in his wheelchair on a wet concrete curb at 4:00 AM. The rain is driving, soaking through his favorite navy blue sweatshirt, his jeans, his shoes, and his socks.

He is physically shattered—shivering violently, suffering from medication withdrawal cramps, and **starving**. His backpack is strapped to the back of his chair, containing the shards of his destroyed AAC device. He has no voice and no plan, except for a couple of crumpled dollar bills in his wallet—money meant for vending machines that is now his only hope for fare on the **TAPS** (Transit Authority of the Puget Sound) bus to the airport.

**The "Rootkit Key":** This song captures the trauma so perfectly that it becomes a permanent, override-proof trigger for Leo. In later years, hearing just the opening notes will bypass his logic centers and cause an immediate autistic meltdown. This reaction is absolute: even if he is **actively being grounded** by all three women (Luna, Olivia, and Stella) and even if they **warn him** the song is about to play, the trigger cannot be stopped.

**LYRICS:**

[Intro]
(Starts with the sound of cold, pouring rain and a deep, pulsing synthesizer bass. A heavy, distorted drum machine beat kicks in—slow and menacing.)

[Verse 1]
The front door clicks, a final sound
A world of silence all around
Just pouring rain on cold blacktop
A spinning life that has to stop
My voice of shattered, useless glass
Is packed away, a future past
This curbstone is an icy throne
I've never felt so all alone

[Chorus]
Just gotta get to the airport
Don't care how, don't care what it costs
A thousand miles from my safe port
A lifeline I can't bear to have lost
This city's just a concrete cage
Gotta turn another page
Just gotta get to the airport
It's the only prayer I've got

[Verse 2]
The streetlights bleed a hazy glare
On empty houses, standing there
My arms are burning, wheels are slow
A dozen blocks still left to go
The chill gets down inside my bones
To whispered fears and silent moans
Is anybody watching me?
Or am I just too lost to see?

[Chorus]
Just gotta get to the airport
Don't care how, don't care what it costs
A thousand miles from my safe port
A lifeline I can't bear to have lost
This city's just a concrete cage
Gotta turn another page
Just gotta get to the airport
It's the only prayer I've got

[Bridge]
A flash of faces in my mind
The only true north I can find
A sister's love, a steady hand
Across this cold and broken land
It's just enough to keep me whole
To fight and reclaim my own soul...

[Guitar Solo]
(Not melodic or soaring. A raw, angry, and distorted guitar solo that sounds like a desperate cry, full of feedback and anguish.)

[Outro]
(Music fades slightly, leaving the drum machine, bass, and the sound of rain. Vocals become a desperate, repeated whisper.)
Airport... airport...
Gotta get there...
(A final, sharp synth stab and the sound of rain fades to silence.)
