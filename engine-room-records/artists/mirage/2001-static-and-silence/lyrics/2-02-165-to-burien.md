**LORE NOTE:**
A tense but driving instrumental that bridges the gap between the "Curbstone" and the "Airport."

This track covers the logistical nightmare of Leo's escape: navigating the **TAPS** (Transit Authority of the Puget Sound) bus network with no voice, no map, and a shattered communication device.
* **Leg 1:** The **165** from the Kent neighborhood to the Kent Train Station. A terrifying moment of vulnerability where Leo has to communicate his needs to strangers without words.
* **The Transfer:** The kindness of strangers: the Route 164 bus operator explained Leo's situation to their dispatcher over the radio, who then radioed ahead to the Route 161 bus to have them be prepared for Leo's arrival.
* **Leg 2:** The **161** from the station to **SEA-TAC Airport**.

The core emotional beat of this track is the **kindness of strangers**. Unlike Delores, the bus operators don't scream at him. They see a young man in a wheelchair, soaking wet, holding a broken screen, and terrified. They take the time to read his desperate, hand-signed gestures. They secure his chair. They get him to the right stop. It is the first humanity he has experienced in weeks.

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track opens with the pneumatic hiss of bus doors opening—a sound that used to signal entrapment, but now signals escape.)

(A steady, forward-moving bassline kicks in at 110 BPM. It is anxious but determined, mimicking the motion of the bus through the rainy morning streets.)

(The melody is carried by a clean, delayed electric guitar. It starts hesitant and shaky—representing Leo's fear of being rejected by the driver—but grows stronger and more melodic as the operator smiles and waves him onboard.)

(The bridge features a "mechanical shift" sound effect, representing the transfer at Kent Station. The tempo picks up slightly. The anxiety of the "High Desert" drone is gone, replaced by a driving, rhythmic focus. He is moving toward the planes.)

(The track ends with the distinct sound of an airport announcement chime.)
