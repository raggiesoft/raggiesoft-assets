**LORE NOTE:**
A tense, minimalist instrumental track built around the unique sonic texture of **Baudot tones** (the screeching data sounds of a TTY machine).

Leo has made it to **SEA-TAC Airport**, but his journey isn't over; he has no ticket and no money. He finds a TTY payphone bank. Having only ever used modern AAC devices, the archaic teletypewriter is alien to him. He doesn't know the protocols—"GA" (Go Ahead) or "SK" (Stop Keying).

Desperate, he dials `0` and types a clumsy request for an emergency collect call to the one number burned into his memory since age 14: his home.

The track captures the agonizing wait as the Relay Operator connects the line. The emotional climax hits not with a musical crescendo, but with a single spoken word sampled from the "Black Box" recording of the call: **Stella accepting the charges.**

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track opens with the harsh, rhythmic *skree-skree* of a TTY handshake connection. It acts as the percussion track.)

(A nervous, staccato synthesizer melody plays, mimicking Leo's hesitant one-finger typing. He ignores the "GA" prompts, just typing a continuous stream of panic.)

(The music drops to a tense silence, broken only by the "ringing" tone.)

[Spoken Sample: Relay Operator]
(Heavily processed, sounding like a distant transmission)
"I have a collect call from... Leo. Will you accept the charges?"

(A beat of silence.)

[Spoken Sample: Stella]
(Clear, frantic, and immediate)
"YES."

(The music instantly shifts from cold industrial anxiety to a warm, swelling major-key pad. The connection is made. The nightmare is over.)

[Outro]
(The sound of rapid typing—Leo pouring his heart out via HCO (Hearing Carry Over)—blends with the warm synth, fading into the next track.)
