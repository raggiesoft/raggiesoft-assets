**LORE NOTE:**
The emotional climax of the saga, but not the instant relief one might expect.

**Part 1: The Longest Hour (Instrumental)**
Leo has made the TTY call. He knows Olivia is coming. But she is in Lynnwood, a 45-minute taxi ride away. This instrumental captures the agonizing wait. Built on a nervous, pulsing synth-bass, it is layered with the distant sounds of a busy terminal. Leo is terrified that Delores might find him before Olivia does.

**Part 2: My Anchor (Reunion)**
The perspective shifts to **Olivia** (Maya). She tears through the terminal and spots him—shivering in his soaked sweatshirt, alone in the crowd.

**The Sonic Conflict:**
Crucially, the "Industrial" static of Disc 1 **does not** instantly vanish. The "Painted Smile" mask is still locked tight on Leo's face; his defenses are on red alert, fearing this is another one of Delores's tricks.
* **The Sound:** You hear the warm, soaring **80s Power Ballad** melody (Olivia/Safety) desperately trying to break through the mix, but it is constantly battered and suppressed by the grinding **Industrial** beat (Trauma/Delores).
* **The Experience:** It sounds like a radio signal fighting through jamming frequency. Leo *sees* her, but he can't let the wall down yet. The "80s" sound only fully conquers the "Industrial" noise in the final, soaring guitar solo—the moment he finally allows himself to be held.

**LYRICS:**

[Part 1: The Longest Hour]
(Instrumental - A tense, building industrial atmosphere. Airport announcements drift in and out of the mix. The tension rises until...)

[Part 2: My Anchor (Reunion)]

[Verse 1]
(Sung by Olivia. The music is chaotic—warm synths clashing with a harsh, mechanical drum beat.)
Searching faces in the crowd
A silent scream that's screaming loud
Just one more hall, just one more sign
This can't be real, this friend of mine
They said you're here, alone and lost
I'll find you, friend, no matter the cost
A thousand miles of fear and pain
Left standing in the pouring rain

[Chorus]
(The 80s melody swells, but the industrial static buzzes over it like interference.)
But I see you there, so small and lost
My broken friend, whatever the cost
I'm running to you, hold on tight
I am your anchor in this night
The storm has passed, the waiting's through
My dearest friend, I'm here for you
I've got you now, you're safe with me
For all the world to finally see

[Verse 2]
(The industrial noise recedes slightly, but the "Threat" drone remains underneath.)
That hooded sweatshirt, soaked and thin
The cold November's gotten in
You're shivering now, your face is pale
Behind a thin and broken veil
Of pride and fear, I see it all
The quiet terror of the fall
She left you here without a coat
A wordless scream caught in your throat

[Chorus]
(The 80s Rock sound gets louder, fighting the static.)
And I see you there, so small and lost
My broken friend, whatever the cost
I'm running to you, hold on tight
I am your anchor in this night
The storm has passed, the waiting's through
My dearest friend, I'm here for you
I've got you now, you're safe with me
For all the world to finally see

[Guitar Solo]
(The Breakthrough. A soaring, melodic 80s solo finally shatters the industrial beat. The static vanishes. The "Mask" falls. Pure, triumphant sound.)

[Chorus]
(Full 80s Arena Rock glory. No static. No fear.)
And I see you there, so small and lost
My broken friend, whatever the cost
I'm running to you, hold on tight
I am your anchor in this night
The storm has passed, the waiting's through
My dearest friend, I'm here for you
I've got you now, you're safe with me
For all the world to finally see
