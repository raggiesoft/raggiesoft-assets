**LORE NOTE:**
A gentle, shimmering synth-pop ballad set in the secure zone of **SEA-TAC Airport**.

The "Airside" represents the first true safe soil. Leo has made it through TSA. The threat of Delores is physically behind the security checkpoint. Now, the healing begins.

**1. The Restoration:** Olivia takes Leo to a family restroom—not to scream at him, but to restore his dignity. She helps him change out of his soaked, filthy clothes into a brand new, dry sweatshirt and sweatpants she bought at a terminal shop. The sensory relief of dry cotton on his skin is treated as a religious experience in the lyrics.

**2. The "Anti-Pasco" Moment:** The pivotal scene occurs when Olivia needs to use the restroom herself. Knowing Leo is too terrified to be left alone, she asks him a question Delores never did: **"Is this okay?"** She asks for his permission. It is a small act that returns a massive amount of agency to him.

**3. The View:** The track ends with them sitting by the window, Leo’s wheelchair positioned so he can watch the planes take off. He is clean, he is fed, he is held, and for the first time in weeks, he is watching the world move without fear.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The water runs, the towel is warm
Washing off the lingering storm
The heavy scent of diesel fumes
 Replaced by soap in quiet rooms
"Lift your arms," a gentle sound
My feet are hovering off the ground
The wet and cold are peeled away
To face the light of this new day

[Chorus]
In the Airside Sanctuary
The world is soft and light
No more shadows, no more scary
Fragments of the night
I'm clean, I'm dry, I'm safe, I'm here
Watching the gray clouds disappear
Airside...
Safe inside...

[Verse 2]
The door is locked, but I'm not trapped
The map of hell has been re-mapped
You turn to me, you meet my eyes
No anger there, no heavy sighs
"Do you mind?" you softly ask
Removing one more heavy mask
You give me space, you give me choice
You give me back my stolen voice

[Chorus]
In the Airside Sanctuary
The world is soft and light
No more shadows, no more scary
Fragments of the night
I'm clean, I'm dry, I'm safe, I'm here
Watching the gray clouds disappear
Airside...
Safe inside...

[Bridge]
(Music swells—cinematic and wide)
Ticket in my pocket, "Gateway" on the wing
Boarding Group A, the finest thing
A miracle of time and chance
A victory in a single glance
The busiest day of all the year
But somehow, we are sitting here...

[Outro]
Turn my chair to face the glass
Watch the heavy shadows pass
The engines roar, the birds take flight
Into the morning light...
Just hold me...
Just hold me...
(Fade out on the drone of a jet engine taking off)
