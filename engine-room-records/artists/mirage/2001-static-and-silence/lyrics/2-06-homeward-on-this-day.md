**LORE NOTE:**
The album's great irony.

Most of the world knows this song as the massive holiday hit by **The Arctic Symphony Project** (a pseudonym Mirage used for their 2002 album *Northern Star Requiem*). That version—soaring, orchestral, and festive—was the soundtrack to the winter of 2002 and was still in heavy rotation when Leo sat in SEA-TAC Airport in **November 2003**. Hearing that bright, hopeful version over the terminal PA is what gave him the strength to believe he might actually make it home.

But on *this* album (released 2001), we hear the **original**: dark, moody, and desperate. This is the song as it was written in the midst of the trauma—a heavy, industrial prayer for rescue.

**Label Note:** Engine Room Records did not mandate the holiday album. Julian and Maya chose to re-record the song in 2002 as an act of reclamation—transforming their darkest moment into a source of pure, commercial joy.

**LYRICS:**

[Intro]
(Starts with a dramatic, slightly melancholic piano melody, soon joined by swelling orchestral strings that build anticipation)

[Verse 1]
A thousand miles of winter gray
Another dawn, another day
The engine's hum, a weary soul
A heavy price, a heavy toll
I see your face on frozen glass
A memory that's built to last
A single light that I must find
To leave the endless dark behind

[Chorus]
And the lights are bright, on this winter's night
Because you're coming home
Yes, you're finally coming home
Through the wind and rain, through the doubt and pain
You are not alone
No, you're finally coming home!

[Verse 2]
The towns fly by, a blur of light
I count the hours in the night
Remembering a whispered vow
It feels so close, it's coming now
The fire's lit, the table's set
A promise that I haven't met
But in my heart, the feeling grows
A warmth that melts the winter snows

[Chorus]
And the lights are bright, on this winter's night
Because you're coming home
Yes, you're finally coming home
Through the wind and rain, through the doubt and pain
You are not alone
No, you're finally coming home!

[Instrumental Bridge]
(Orchestra swells, strings become more frantic and dramatic)

[Guitar Solo]
(A powerful, melodic, and emotional electric guitar solo soars over the orchestra, telling the story of the struggle and the breakthrough)

[Chorus]
And the lights are bright, on this winter's night
Because you're coming home
Yes, you're finally coming home
Through the wind and rain, through the doubt and pain
You are not alone
No, you're finally coming home!

[Outro]
(Music becomes even more grand and layered with powerful choral vocals)
Coming home!
(Finally coming home!)
On this day!
(The orchestra and guitar build to a final, triumphant chord and fade)
