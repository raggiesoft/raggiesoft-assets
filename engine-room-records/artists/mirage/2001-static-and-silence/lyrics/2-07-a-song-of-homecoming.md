**LORE NOTE:**
A driving, mid-tempo rock anthem that balances anxiety with ascending hope.

The setting is the **Gate Area** at SEA-TAC. Leo and Olivia are waiting for **Gateway Airlines**. Because the airline has no assigned seating, a chaotic, aggressive queue is forming, triggering Leo's sensory overload. He braces himself to be crushed in the rush, terrified he will be separated from Olivia.

**The Pre-Boarding Revelation:**
Leo doesn't know that his disability gives him the right to pre-board. He expects a fight. Instead, Olivia calmly guides him past the line. The Gate Agent doesn't stop them; she smiles and waves them through before anyone else. The realization that he has rights—that he isn't just cargo—is the spark that finally ignites the "Homecoming" chorus.

**The Internal Conflict:**
Leo holds his boarding pass with a death grip. His "Painted Smile" mask is still partially engaged; his eyes dart around the terminal, half-expecting Delores (Vanessa) to burst through security and drag him back. He cannot fully believe he is leaving until the wheels actually leave the ground.

**The Sound:**
The track features a nervous, staccato guitar riff (the anxiety of the crowd) that slowly opens up into a wide, majestic chorus (the quiet safety of the jetway). The "Industrial" noise of the city is still present in the verses—hissing steam, mechanical clatter—but the chorus is pure, sweeping 80s optimism, representing Olivia's steady presence guiding him home.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The monitor flickers, the crowd begins to sway
I'm bracing for the crush, the price I have to pay
The noise is getting louder, the air is getting thin
I'm terrified of losing you amidst the din
But then you touch my shoulder, you guide me past the line
"We're going first," you whisper, "This moment is all mine"
The agent scans the paper, the heavy door swings wide
Leaving all the chaos and the angry noise outside

[Chorus]
And I hear a song of homecoming
Underneath the fear, a steady humming
A melody that's calling me away
To the light of a brand new day
It's faint and fragile, but it's true
I'm walking down this hall with you
A song of homecoming...
Please let it be true...

[Verse 2]
The tunnel is so quiet, the carpet soft and gray
A silence that I haven't heard for many, many days
I check behind me, trembling, just one last time
Searching for the punishment, searching for the crime
But there's only empty hallway and the echo of our feet
And the promise of a window seat
You help me to the transfer, you buckle me in tight
For the first time in forever, I'm ready for the flight

[Chorus]
And I hear a song of homecoming
Underneath the fear, a steady humming
A melody that's calling me away
To the light of a brand new day
It's faint and fragile, but it's true
I'm walking down this hall with you
A song of homecoming...
Please let it be true...

[Bridge]
(The music swells. The industrial clatter fades completely, replaced by the rising, high-pitched whine of jet turbines spooling up.)
The cabin pressure, the safety sign
For the first time in months, this life is mine
You take my hand, you squeeze it tight
We're lifting off into the night!

[Outro]
(The drums kick into a double-time beat—the takeoff roll.)
We're going home!
We're going home!
Don't look back!
We're going home!
(Fade out on the roar of engines)
