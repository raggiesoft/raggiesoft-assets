**LORE NOTE:**
The "exhale" after four days of holding his breath. A soaring, weightless synth-pop anthem that captures the pure euphoria of escape.

The setting is **Gateway Airlines Flight 1138**, climbing out of Seattle en route to Chicago (MDW). Leo and Olivia are in **Row 2**. Leo watched the boarding door like a hawk until it thudded shut, confirming **Delores was not on board.**

**The "Safety" Beat:**
For the takeoff, Leo is rigid, following every FAA rule out of fear. It isn't until the plane breaks through the cloud layer and the **10,000-foot chime** rings that he finally breaks. The "ding" is his permission to let go. He reclines his seat, lowers the tray table, and curls into Olivia's shoulder. Today is the first time he has been touched with genuine, non-transactional love since the nightmare began.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
The engine hums a steady beat
Thirty thousand tired feet
Above the clouds, a sea of white
Escaping from the endless night
Your hand in mine, a steady grace
The only anchor in this place
You let me lean against your side
With nothing left to run or hide

[Chorus]
(Music swells with a warm, gentle, and melodic feel)
And for the first time in so long, I can breathe
A quiet promise, I believe
Your shoulder is my only home right now
A silent, true, and sacred vow
This sanctuary in the sky
Beneath a calm and endless eye
Is all I need to feel okay
And chase the lingering fog away

[Verse 2]
I think about the static sound
On that unholy, hollow ground
I think about the pouring rain
The endless fear, the burning pain
But then I feel you squeeze my hand
And I begin to understand
The storm has passed, the war is done
A quiet battle has been won

[Chorus]
(Music swells with a warm, gentle, and melodic feel)
And for the first time in so long, I can breathe
A quiet promise, I believe
Your shoulder is my only home right now
A silent, true, and sacred vow
This sanctuary in the sky
Beneath a calm and endless eye
Is all I need to feel okay
And chase the lingering fog away

[Instrumental Bridge]
(A melodic, slightly melancholic, but ultimately hopeful synthesizer solo, with clean, arpeggiated notes that sound like data flowing before fading out.)

[Outro]
(Music fades to just a low, humming drone, like the cabin of the plane. The vocals are a quiet, spoken-word whisper.)
My anchor...
Safe...
Thank you...
