**LORE NOTE:**
An upbeat, kinetic electronic instrumental that chronicles the final leg of the journey: **Flight 492 from Chicago Midway (MDW) to Norfolk (ORF)**.

After the terror of the bus stations and the white-knuckle tension of Sea-Tac, the transfer at Midway was miraculously simple. No screaming, no running, no "Pasco Lock" moments. Just Olivia guiding him calmly to the next gate, buying him a magazine, and boarding the plane.

The music reflects this new reality. The "Industrial" grit of Disc 1 is completely purged from the mix, replaced by clean, arpeggiated synthesizers and a steady, propulsive 125 BPM beat. It is the sound of a plane cutting through the night sky, carrying Leo back to the only people who truly know him. The mood is no longer about *escaping*; it is about *arriving*.

**LYRICS:**

[Instrumental]

(The track opens with a clean, rapid electronic drum beat at 125 BPM—fast, eager, and light.)

(A warm, melodic synthesizer bass line enters, driving the song forward with a sense of purpose. It feels like the heartbeat of someone running toward a finish line.)

(Layers of bright, arpeggiated synthesizers build on top, creating a "flying" sensation. The melody is major-key, hopeful, and ascending.)

(The bridge features a shimmering "starfall" sound effect, representing the lights of the East Coast appearing on the horizon.)

(The track ends not with a fade, but with a triumphant, sustained chord that resolves perfectly into the next track.)
