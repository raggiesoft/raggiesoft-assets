**LORE NOTE:**
The album's emotional climax. The setting is the arrival gate at **Norfolk International Airport (ORF)**.

When Leo rolls off the jetway and sees Stella and Luna waiting for him, the overwhelming relief triggers the most severe autistic meltdown of his life. It is a "System Crash" born of the unbearable reality that he is actually safe.

**The Promise:**
The most critical moment of the entire rock opera occurs in the second verse. **Luna (Isabella Croft)** delivers the line that finally breaks the trauma loop: **"Your broken heart will mend with time."**

This isn't a platitude. It is a binding vow from sister to brother. It is Luna using her voice to overwrite the damage Delores did, promising him that his current pain is temporary, but his family is permanent. When she sings this line, the "Painted Smile" mask doesn't just fall; it shatters, and Leo finally allows himself to be held.

**LYRICS:**

[Intro]
(The track opens with a wall of chaotic, industrial noise—distorted static, rushing wind, and a frantic, irregular heartbeat. It builds to an unbearable peak, then...)

(Silence.)

(A warm, gentle synth pad fades in. Clean, melodic electric guitar notes chime like bells.)

[Verse 1]
(Sung by Luna [Izzy Croft] - Clear, gentle, and unwavering)
The storm is over now, the static's gone
Right here is where you've been all along
Your voice was lost, your world was gray
We're here to chase the dark away
You walked through fire, you walked through rain
But you will never walk alone again

[Chorus]
We are your sanctuary in the storm
A fire here to keep you safe and warm
Inside this circle, held so tight
We'll be your true and gentle light
So let the painted smile fall down
You're standing on your native ground
You're home... you're finally home

[Verse 2]
The mask you wore is on the floor
You don't need it anymore
The silence has no power here
We'll banish every single fear
Just let it go, the heavy load
At the ending of this lonely road
Just lean on us, we'll hold the line
**Your broken heart will mend with time**

[Chorus]
We are your sanctuary in the storm
A fire here to keep you safe and warm
Inside this circle, held so tight
We'll be your true and gentle light
So let the painted smile fall down
You're standing on your native ground
You're home... you're finally home

[Guitar Solo]
(A soaring, melodic, and deeply emotional 80s power ballad guitar solo. It sounds like a release of breath held for four days.)

[Outro]
You're home... you're finally home
We are your sanctuary... you're not alone.
(Fades out on a warm, unresolved major chord)
