**LORE NOTE:**
After the quiet, personal resolution of "Sanctuary," this track is the sound of pure, explosive, cathartic release.

**The Scene:**
Leo is in the backseat of Stella's car, sandwiched between Olivia and Luna. They are leaving the airport. Stella turns on the radio. The commercials end, and **this song** kicks in.

**The Sonic Shift:**
To represent Leo's internal state, the album version of this track begins with a "Fake-Out."
* **0:00 - 0:45:** It starts as a dark, heavy **Industrial** track—the lingering static of Delores's world.
* **The Break:** Suddenly, a clean, arpeggiated electric guitar riff cuts through the noise like a knife.
* **The Explosion:** The song erupts into a triumphant, unironic **Late-80s Hard Rock Anthem**. The industrial gloom vanishes, replaced by "Hair Metal" drums, soaring vocals, and the joy of a open highway.

For Leo, this isn't just a song; it is the sound of his authentic self returning. He is 19, he is safe, and he is finally, truly home.

**LYRICS:**

[Intro]
(The track opens with a heavy, distorted industrial drum machine and pulsing synth-bass—tense and weary.)

(Suddenly, a clean, chorus-drenched electric guitar riff cuts through the noise.)

(A massive, live drum fill kicks the song into high gear. The industrial sounds vanish instantly.)

[Verse 1]
Been on the road for a million miles
Seen a thousand tears and a thousand fake smiles
This engine's screamin', the diesel's burnin' low
Got nowhere left that I can go
I'm tired of the fightin', sick of the lies
Just wanna see my own familiar skies

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you take me home to Haven City!
Where the harbor lights are burning pretty!
Oh, won't you please just take me home, yeah!
Yeah, take me home to Haven City!
Leave the broken past for all to pity!
Oh, won't you please just take me home!

[Verse 2]
See the harbor lights up through the mist
A promise that I can't resist
Heard a kind voice on the telephone
Said 'boy, it's time that you came on home'
I'm done with darkness, done with pain
Standing out in the pouring rain

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you take me home to Haven City!
Where the harbor lights are burning pretty!
Oh, won't you please just take me home, yeah!
Yeah, take me home to Haven City!
Leave the broken past for all to pity!
Oh, won't you please just take me home!

[Guitar Solo]
(A soaring, melodic, and virtuosic late-80s hard rock guitar solo with massive bends and a triumphant, "stadium" feel.)

[Outro - Double Time]
(The tempo kicks up into a driving double-time rhythm)
Take me home!
(Oh, won't you please take me home!)
Take me home!
(To the Haven City!)
Take me home!
(Yeah!)
Take me home!
(To the harbor lights burning pretty!)
Take me home! HOME!
(Music ends with a final, crashing power chord and feedback)
