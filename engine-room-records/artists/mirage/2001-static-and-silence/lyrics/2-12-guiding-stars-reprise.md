**LORE NOTE:**
The thematic epilogue of *Static & Silence*.

This track serves as a direct response to the album opener, "Nineteen and Invincible." In that first song, a naive Leo sang about his "three guiding stars" (Stella, Luna, and Olivia) with innocent optimism. Now, after surviving the industrial nightmare of Disc 1, he returns to that melody with a profound, weary gratitude.

He realizes that his sisters and best friend weren't just "guiding" him; they were the only things that kept him alive. The lyrics explicitly reference the trauma mechanisms he developed ("I learned to wear a painted smile / And walk a cold and lonely mile"), acknowledging the scars that will remain. But the music—a calm, sophisticated 80s pop arrangement featuring a soulful saxophone—signals that while the innocence is gone, the safety is permanent. He vows never to leave the Fortress again.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
There was a boy I used to be
Who saw the world so simply
Thought every road was straight and true
Beneath a sky of perfect blue
He thought that love was just a phrase
For sunny, easy, golden days
He called you all his guiding stars
Before he knew about the scars

[Chorus]
But I learned the sky can fall away
And turn a bright and sunny day to gray
And in the static and the night
You were my only guiding light
More than a feeling, more than a name
You were the fire, you were the flame
That led me through the pouring rain
And brought me back to life again

[Verse 2]
I learned to wear a painted smile
And walk a cold and lonely mile
To build a wall of industrial sound
On cold and unfamiliar ground
I learned how silence has a weight
And how a heart can fill with hate
I learned that trust can be a lie
Beneath a cold and empty sky

[Bridge]
Two stars are here, held close and tight
One shines a warm and distant light
A friendly face on a glowing screen
The miles can't ever come between
The bond we made, the truth we know
Helping a broken boy to grow

[Chorus]
And when the sky would fall away
And turn a bright and sunny day to gray
And in the static and the night
You were my only guiding light
More than a feeling, more than a name
You were the fire, you were the flame
That led me through the pouring rain
And brought me back to life again

[Instrumental Outro]
(A gentle, melodic, and deeply soulful saxophone solo plays, full of quiet reflection and gratitude. It weaves around the main melody, lingering like a long exhale, as the music slowly fades to silence.)
