**LORE NOTE:**
A fierce, protective power ballad sung entirely by **Luna (Isabella Croft)**.

This is the "Warrior Sister" anthem. Having nearly lost her twin brother to the silence of Delores, Luna makes a binding vow: she will never let him drift away again. The lyrics are not just a comfort; they are a declaration of intent. If the darkness comes back, she won't just call his name—she will physically **drag** him back to safety.

**The Sonic Duel:**
In a unique production choice, the track features a duel between a heavy, distorted electric guitar (representing the threat/trauma) and a piercing, aggressive **Flute** (representing Luna).

The guitar tries to dominate the mix, but the flute weaves through the distortion, matching it note-for-note in intensity and volume. It is a sonic metaphor for Luna's promise: she isn't afraid of the noise anymore. She will cut through any static to find him.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
I saw the static in your eyes
The silent screams, the practiced lies
A painted smile, a hollow shell
Trapped inside a private hell
I tried to call, I tried to warn
On that cold and broken morn
You couldn't hear my quiet plea
But you are finally back with me

[Chorus]
And I will never let you go again
This is a promise, not a "what if" or a "when"
If the darkness ever calls your name
I'll be the fire, I'll be the flame
And if I have to, with my own two hands
I'll drag you back from those broken lands

[Verse 2]
I'll be the flute song in your head
For every single word unsaid
A steady note, a gentle sound
On this new and solid ground
No more silence, no more fear
As long as I am standing here
You'll never have to walk alone
I'll bring my broken brother home

[Chorus]
And I will never let you go again
This is a promise, not a "what if" or a "when"
If the darkness ever calls your name
I'll be the fire, I'll be the flame
And if I have to, with my own two hands
I'll drag you back from those broken lands

[Instrumental Solo]
(A fierce, technical duel between the electric guitar and the flute. The guitar growls with distortion, but the flute soars above it, piercing and undeniable, ultimately claiming the final, sustained high note.)

[Chorus]
And I will never let you go again
This is a promise, not a "what if" or a "when"
If the darkness ever calls your name
I'll be the fire, I'll be the flame
And if I have to, with my own two hands
I'll drag you back from those broken lands
