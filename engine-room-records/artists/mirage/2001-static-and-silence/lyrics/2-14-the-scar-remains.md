**LORE NOTE:**
A mature, reflective rock track that serves as the thematic resolution of the album.

If "Sanctuary" was the relief of rescue, **"The Scar Remains"** is the hard work of recovery. Leo acknowledges that he cannot simply "reset" to the boy he was in Track 1 ("Nineteen and Invincible"). That version of him is gone, lost to the "Long Road West."

Instead of fighting this loss, he accepts it. The lyrics describe the slow, non-linear process of learning to trust again—not just his family, but his own judgment.

**The Sonic Synthesis:**
Musically, this track represents the complete integration of the band's sound. It features **Luna's Flute** (representing her emotional promise) weaving seamlessly with **Stella's New Wave Synthesizer** (representing her structural protection), both grounded by a steady, classic 80s rock beat. It is the sound of his support system becoming part of his own internal rhythm.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to find that boy I knew
In shades of brilliant white and blue
The one who thought he had it made
Before the colors start to fade
He's still in here, a distant ghost
The one I miss and fear the most
A part of me is lost, it's true
A space that was reserved for you... Olivia

[Chorus]
But the scars remain, a map to trace
And they have found their proper place
I'm standing on a different floor
Than I was standing on before
And I can hear a brand new sound
On this new and solid ground
The echo of a worried flute
A synthesizer's loving root

[Verse 2]
I'm learning how to trust again
To let the gentle sunlight in
I'm learning that a helping hand
Can help a broken boy to stand
I'm learning that a home can be
A fortress built for only me
By two strong women, brave and true
Who know exactly what to do

[Chorus]
'Cause the scars remain, a map to trace
And they have found their proper place
I'm standing on a different floor
Than I was standing on before
And I can hear a brand new sound
On this new and solid ground
The echo of a worried flute
A synthesizer's loving root

[Instrumental Outro]
(The flute and synthesizer trade melodies, harmonizing over the rock beat before fading into a warm, sustained chord.)
