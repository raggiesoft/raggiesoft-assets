**LORE NOTE:**
The album's finale. A powerful, reassuring vow sung by **Stella (Beatrice Croft)**.

Throughout the album, Leo has been the one searching for safety. In this final track, Stella confirms that the search is over. She directly addresses the specific traumas Delores inflicted—the "shifting sands" of gaslighting, the "slamming doors" of isolation, and the "cage" of non-consensual touch.

She counters each trauma with a permanent architectural promise: **"This House Stands."** It is a declaration that their family unit is a fortress that will never break. She swears that he will never face abuse again, not because the world is safe, but because *she* is standing between him and the world.

**LYRICS:**

[Verse 1]
You learned to live in shifting sands
With no safe place to ever land
You learned that doors could slam and lock
Against the ticking of the clock
You learned that touch could be a cage
A quiet, simmering, bitter rage
But that old world is dead and gone
It's time to face a brand new dawn

[Chorus]
So let my arms be your new walls
To catch you every time you fall
This house stands, it will not break
For your own precious, gentle sake
If it's a hug that you should need
A simple, pure, and loving creed
Then I am here, my love is true
My arms will be a home for you

[Verse 2]
No need to brace, no need to hide
With your two sisters by your side
We'll be the lock, we'll be the key
To your own safe reality
We'll be the roof against the rain
To wash away the hurt and pain
This is a vow we'll always keep
While you are in your troubled sleep

[Guitar Solo]
(A clean, melodic, and triumphant guitar solo. It doesn't shred; it builds a steady, unbreakable wall of sound.)

[Chorus]
So let my arms be your new walls
To catch you every time you fall
This house stands, it will not break
For your own precious, gentle sake
If it's a hug that you should need
A simple, pure, and loving creed
Then I am here, my love is true
My arms will be a home for you

[Outro]
This house stands...
For you...
(Final sustained chord, resolving perfectly into silence)
