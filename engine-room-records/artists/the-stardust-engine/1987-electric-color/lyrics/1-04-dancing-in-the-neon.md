**LORE NOTE:**
"I wanna see you dancing to this one, Chicago!" A crowd-pleaser that fit the label's "pop" image perfectly. This was one of the "safe" synth-pop singles Apex Records pushed for, prioritizing high energy and polished production over the band's rock roots.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The city's quiet, the sun is down
We're in the glow of the other side of town
The beat is calling from a place I know
Just follow the sound, and let it go

(Chorus)
We're dancing in the neon (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're moving 'til the night is gone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Forget about tomorrow
We're shining like a light
Dancing in the neon tonight!

(Verse 2)
The rhythm's heavy, a flashing bright
Reflected colors in your eyes
I don't care what the real world wants
This moment's all that I could ever want

(Chorus)
We're dancing in the neon (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're moving 'til the night is gone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Forget about tomorrow
We're shining like a light
Dancing in the neon tonight!

(Bridge)
Don't stop, don't stop the feeling
This music's got me reeling
Don't stop, don't stop the beat
(Synth-pop breakdown / keyboard solo)

(Chorus)
We're dancing in the neon (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're moving 'til the night is gone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Forget about tomorrow
We're shining like a light
Dancing in the neon tonight!

(Outro)
Dancing in the neon... (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Til the night is gone...
