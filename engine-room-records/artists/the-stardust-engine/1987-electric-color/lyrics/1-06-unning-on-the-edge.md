**LORE NOTE:**
Another protest song. Ryan sings about being a "shadow in the light" and having his guitar suppressed ("This keyboard hook is all a bore / I know this guitar's made for more"). It features angsty, anti-corporate lyrics hidden inside a "safe" pop-rock wrapper.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
Another day, another show
They tell me which way the wind should blow
I'm smiling 'til my face is numb
Waiting for the day to come

(Pre-Chorus)
I can hear a different sound
A rumble starting underground
This pretty world is gonna break
How much more can I take?

(Chorus)
I'm running on the edge, about to lose control (Oh-oh-oh)
Trying to save my rock and roll soul
I'm running on the edge, a shadow in the light (Oh-oh-oh)
Gonna break out into the night!

(Verse 2)
This keyboard hook is all a bore
I know this guitar's made for more
I want to feel the fire and grit
I'm getting really sick of it

(Pre-Chorus)
I can hear a different sound
A rumble starting underground
This pretty world is gonna break
How much more can I take?

(Chorus)
I'm running on the edge, about to lose control (Oh-oh-oh)
Trying to save my rock and roll soul
I'm running on the edge, a shadow in the light (Oh-oh-oh)
Gonna break out into the night!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
I'm running on the edge, about to lose control (Oh-oh-oh)
Trying to save my rock and roll soul
I'm running on the edge, a shadow in the light (Oh-oh-oh)
Gonna break out into the night!

(Outro)
Running on the edge...
Running on the edge...
