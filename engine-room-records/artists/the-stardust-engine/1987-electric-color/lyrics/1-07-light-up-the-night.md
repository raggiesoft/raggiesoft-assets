**LORE NOTE:**
The song Apex Records poured *all* of their money into. They were convinced this polished synth-pop track would be "The Big One." It wasn't. Despite the massive marketing campaign, the "safe" sound failed to connect with audiences in the way the band's authentic rock tracks did.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
I was walking in the shadows
I was living in the gray
Waiting for a signal
To help me find my way

(Pre-Chorus)
I can feel a new connection
Like a spark inside the dark
You're my one true direction
You're the fire, you're the spark

(Chorus)
We're gonna light up the night! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Chasing the stars 'til the morning light
We're gonna make it all right (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Turning our color on, shining so bright
We're gonna light up the night!

(Verse 2)
This city sleeps, but we're awake
A promise that we'll never break
The future's ours, I see the sign
Just put your hand in mine

(Pre-Chorus)
I can feel a new connection
Like a spark inside the dark
You're my one true direction
You're the fire, you're the spark

(Chorus)
We're gonna light up the night! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Chasing the stars 'til the morning light
We're gonna make it all right (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Turning our color on, shining so bright
We're gonna light up the night!

(Bridge)
No more shadows, no more gray
(Keyboard Solo)

(Chorus)
We're gonna light up the night! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Chasing the stars 'til the morning light
We're gonna make it all right (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Turning our color on, shining so bright
We're gonna light up the night!

(Outro)
Light up the night... (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Shining so bright...
