**LORE NOTE:**
The one "pure rock" anthem Apex allowed on the album. It opened Side B and became an immediate fan-favorite for its raw energy. While the studio pushed "Light Up the Night," the fans embraced this track as the true spirit of the band.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
Been counting the days in this neon cage
Smiling for the cameras on a plastic stage
They turned the synths up, drowned the sound
But you can't keep a good thing down

(Chorus)
We're gonna break the walls tonight! (Yeah!)
Turn up the volume, hit the light!
No more whispers, time to shout
The Engine's roaring, let it out!

(Verse 2)
I'm tired of the glitter, tired of the gloss
Tired of the suits who think they're the boss
This guitar is loaded, it's ready to scream
Waking up from their pretty dream

(Chorus)
We're gonna break the walls tonight! (Yeah!)
Turn up the volume, hit the light!
No more whispers, time to shout
The Engine's roaring, let it out!

(Guitar Solo)
(A blistering, technical, shredding solo that Ryan fought to keep on the record)

(Bridge)
For every kid who feels the same
Trapped in a world, playing their game
This one's for you, this one's for me
Time to be free!

(Chorus)
We're gonna break the walls tonight! (Yeah!)
Turn up the volume, hit the light!
No more whispers, time to shout
The Engine's roaring, let it out!

(Outro)
Let it out!
Break the walls!
C'mon!
(fades on a hanging guitar chord)
