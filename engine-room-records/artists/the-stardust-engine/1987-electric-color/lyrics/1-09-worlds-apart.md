**LORE NOTE:**
An epic mid-tempo rock ballad that defied the studio's attempt to separate the band's "Stardust" and "Engine" personas. It features a massive, soaring duet between Ryan and Cassidy, proving their voices worked best when fighting together rather than apart. The lyrics in the third verse ("They want the 'Stardust,' they want the 'Engine'") are a direct meta-commentary on their struggle with Apex Records.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
Another mile on a lonely road
Just trying to get back to you
I'm carrying this heavy load
They're telling me what I have to do

(Verse 2)
The lights are bright, the stage is cold
They're trying to fit me in their mold
I see your face across the black
I know that we can find our way back

(Chorus)
We're worlds apart, but our hearts beat the same (Oh-oh)
I can hear you call my name
Through the distance, through the static and the dark
We're finding a way back to the start (Oh-oh)
Even when we're worlds apart

(Verse 3)
They want the "Stardust," they want the "Engine"
A different version for a different show
But we're the ones who'll be here in the end
We've got a fire they'll never know

(Chorus)
We're worlds apart, but our hearts beat the same (Oh-oh)
I can hear you call my name
Through the distance, through the static and the dark
We're finding a way back to the start (Oh-oh)
Even when we're worlds apart

(Guitar Solo)

(Bridge)
And when the mountains fall
And when the oceans rise
I'll find you (I'll find you!)

(Chorus)
We're worlds apart, but our hearts beat the same (Oh-oh)
I can hear you call my name
Through the distance, through the static and the dark
We're finding a way back to the start (Oh-oh)
Even when we're worlds apart

(Outro)
Worlds apart...
