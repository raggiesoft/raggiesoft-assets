**LORE NOTE:**
A "safe" filler track demanded by Apex to pad out the album with radio-friendly pop. Ryan was explicitly banned from playing on this track ("No guitar allowed" was written on the session sheet), leaving Cassidy isolated with just a synthesizer backing track. Her vocal performance is genuinely upset, but not because of a breakup—she was miserable recording without her brother in the studio.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The clock on the wall is ticking slow
I'm watching the rain fall on the window
I pick up the phone, but I let it go
Just waiting for a voice I know

(Chorus)
It's just another night without you (Oh-oh)
Another night I've got to get through
The city's sleeping, but I'm awake
Another night, for goodness sake

(Verse 2)
The TV's on, but the sound is low
I've got no other place to go
The silence is a heavy sound
I wish that you were here right now

(Chorus)
It's just another night without you (Oh-oh)
Another night I've got to get through
The city's sleeping, but I'm awake
Another night, for goodness sake

(Bridge)
(A very simple, minimal, clean keyboard solo. No guitar allowed.)

(Chorus)
It's just another night without you (Oh-oh)
Another night I've got to get through
The city's sleeping, but I'm awake
Another night, for goodness sake

(Outro)
Another night...
Another night...
(fades out)
