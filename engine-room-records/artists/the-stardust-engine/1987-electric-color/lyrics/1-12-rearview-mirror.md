**LORE NOTE:**
A moody, atmospheric "driving song" that sets the stage for the album's finale. While Apex approved it for its polished synth-pop sound, Cassidy used the lyrics to express her feeling of being a "passenger" in her own career. The poignant line "With all this 'Stardust' left inside" serves as a double entendre for her suppressed creative potential vs. the manufactured image she was forced to project.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
Another city, another night
We're speeding past the exit light
I see the skyline start to fade
A memory of a choice I made

(Chorus)
I'm looking in the rearview mirror
The past is getting clearer
Was it all just a mistake?
A heart that's learning how to break
It's all in the rearview mirror

(Verse 2)
This neon glow feels cold and thin
I don't know where I'm supposed to begin
I'm just a passenger in this ride
With all this "Stardust" left inside

(Chorus)
I'm looking in the rearview mirror
The past is getting clearer
Was it all just a mistake?
A heart that's learning how to break
It's all in the rearview mirror

(Bridge)
(A moody, atmospheric keyboard solo)
I'm driving fast, but I'm not free
Just running from the girl I used to be

(Chorus)
I'm looking in the rearview mirror
The past is getting clearer
Was it all just a mistake?
A heart that's learning how to break
It's all in the rearview mirror

(Outro)
Fading... fading...
In the rearview mirror...
(fades)
