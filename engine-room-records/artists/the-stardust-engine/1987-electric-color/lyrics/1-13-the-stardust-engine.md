**LORE NOTE:**
Buried at the end of the album, this is the band's true anthem. It is the only track on the debut that perfectly blends the "Stardust" (synths) and "Engine" (rock) identities. Critics and chart historians agree: had Apex released this as the lead single instead of burying it, it would have spent **11 straight weeks at #1**, dethroning the existing record holder for the decade.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
We were looking for a signal
A light in the endless black
A single voice in the universe
To tell us we're on the right track

(Verse 2)
We found the fire in the wires
We found the heart in the machine
Building a dream from nothing
A sound the world has never seen

(Chorus)
We are the Stardust Engine!
Racing through the night
We're burning on the fuel of a brand new light
We are the Stardust Engine!
Yeah, we're taking flight
Turning our future on, shining so bright!

(Verse 3)
They tried to ground us, keep us small
Tell us that we were gonna fall
But they don't know the things we know
They haven't seen the places we'll go

(Chorus)
We are the Stardust Engine!
Racing through the night
We're burning on the fuel of a brand new light
We are the Stardust Engine!
Yeah, we're taking flight
Turning our future on, shining so bright!

(Guitar Solo)
(A soaring, melodic solo that trades licks with a bright synthesizer hook)

(Bridge)
We are the cosmos, we are the fire
We're taking this one, higher and higher
We are the Stardust!
(We are the Engine!)
We are the Stardust Engine!

(Chorus)
We are the Stardust Engine!
Racing through the night
We're burning on the fuel of a brand new light
We are the Stardust Engine!
Yeah, we're taking flight
Turning our future on, shining so bright!

(Outro)
Shining so bright...
We're taking flight...
(fades out on an epic, sustained guitar chord)
