**LORE NOTE:**
The studio's furious overcorrection to "Hollow Sound." After Ryan delivered a 5:31 protest track, Apex demanded an absurdly short, safe pop song to balance the runtime and "fix" the album's pacing. The result is this 1:54 "bubblegum" track that feels almost manic in its enforced cheerfulness.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
When the rain is falling
And you feel all alone
Just remember I'm here
You can call me on the phone

(Chorus)
'Cause we're always better together
In any kind of weather
We don't have to hide
We're walking side by side (Oh-oh)
Side by side

(Verse 2)
The world can be a lonely place
A fast and hurried, crazy race
But we can slow it down a while
It's always better when I see you smile

(Chorus)
'Cause we're always better together
In any kind of weather
We don't have to hide
We're walking side by side (Oh-oh)
Side by side

(Bridge)
(A very short, simple, melodic keyboard riff)
Through the highs, through the lows
That's just the way it goes

(Chorus)
'Cause we're always better together
In any kind of weather
We don't have to hide
We're walking side by side (Oh-oh)
Side by side

(Outro)
Side by side...
(fades quickly)
