**LORE NOTE:**
Ryan's "Trojan Horse." The track opens with a bright, optimistic keyboard hook that promises a radio-friendly hit, but the lyrics are a scathing critique of the studio's formulaic songwriting process. Ryan delivered the exact "polished sheen" Apex demanded, but used it to sing about how "safe" and suffocating the production had become ("Turn on the keyboard, keep the guitar low").

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
They hand me the chords, they're all the same
A different title for the same old game
Turn on the keyboard, keep the guitar low
Just another track for the radio

(Chorus)
It's just the same old song (Oh-oh)
Another right to make a wrong
I'm singing words I don't believe
It's getting harder and harder to breathe
It's just the same old song

(Verse 2)
I'm dreaming of a feedback wail
A drum kit hit like a hammer on a nail
But all I get is this polished sheen
The safest sound you've ever seen

(Chorus)
It's just the same old song (Oh-oh)
Another right to make a wrong
I'm singing words I don't believe
It's getting harder and harder to breathe
It's just the same old song

(Bridge)
(A very clean, melodic, studio-approved guitar solo)
Is anybody listening?
Is anybody real?
Or do you just like the way it feels?

(Chorus)
It's just the same old song (Oh-oh)
Another right to make a wrong
I'm singing words I don't believe
It's getting harder and harder to breathe
It's just the same old song

(Outro)
The same old song...
(fades out)
