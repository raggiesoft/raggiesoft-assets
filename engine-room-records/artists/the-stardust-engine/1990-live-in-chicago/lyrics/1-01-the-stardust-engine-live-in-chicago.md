**LORE NOTE:**
This track is the "Smoking Gun" that proves Julian Vance (the executive behind the *Friction* disaster) never did his homework. In the intro, Ryan O'Connell—who, like his sister, is autistic and values absolute clarity—explicitly introduces Cassidy as "my sister," publicly disproving the "married couple" assumption years before it destroyed their contract.

Musically, this recording is a source of fury for the band. It was the only concession Apex made—allowing them to play their self-titled anthem as the opener of their strict 30-minute support slot. However, the mix is "sabotaged": Cassidy's iconic "Stardust" synth leitmotif—the musical heart of the song—is buried so deep in the mix it is practically inaudible, leaving only the "Engine" rock elements.

**LYRICS:**

(Spoken Intro)
Hello Chicago! I'm Ryan O'Connell!
(Crowd cheers)
And this is my sister, Cassidy!
(Crowd cheers louder)
And we are The Stardust Engine!

(Verse 1)
We were looking for a signal
A light in the endless black
A single voice in the universe
To tell us we're on the right track

(Verse 2)
We found the fire in the wires
We found the heart in the machine
Building a dream from nothing
A sound the world has never seen

(Chorus)
We are the Stardust Engine!
Racing through the night
We're burning on the fuel of a brand new light
We are the Stardust Engine!
Yeah, we're taking flight
Turning our future on, shining so bright!

(Verse 3)
They tried to ground us, keep us small
Tell us that we were gonna fall
But they don't know the things we know
They haven't seen the places we'll go

(Chorus)
We are the Stardust Engine!
Racing through the night
We're burning on the fuel of a brand new light
We are the Stardust Engine!
Yeah, we're taking flight
Turning our future on, shining so bright!

(Guitar Solo)
(Ryan plays a blistering solo, but the "Call and Response" synth notes are frustratingly faint in the mix)

(Bridge)
We are the cosmos, we are the fire
We're taking this one, higher and higher
We are the Stardust!
(We are the Engine!)
We are the Stardust Engine!

(Chorus)
We are the Stardust Engine!
Racing through the night
We're burning on the fuel of a brand new light
We are the Stardust Engine!
Yeah, we're taking flight
Turning our future on, shining so bright!

(Outro)
Shining so bright...
We're taking flight...
(Spoken) Thank you!
