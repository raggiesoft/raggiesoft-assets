**LORE NOTE:**
As the title track of the album they were touring, this was a mandatory inclusion in the setlist. Apex Records insisted the band focus on their "Stardust" synth-pop sound to promote the new record, forcing Ryan to play the "good soldier" and deliver a polished, high-energy performance, even as he chafed against the "safe" creative direction.

**LYRICS:**

(Spoken Intro)
Thank you so much!
This is the title track from our brand new album, *Neon Hearts*!

(Verse 1)
The city's humming, the lights are low
I'm waiting for you, I'm ready to go
The rain is tapping on the glass
I knew this feeling was built to last

(Pre-Chorus)
I hear your footsteps in the hall
I'm not afraid to fall
This is the only thing I know is true

(Chorus)
You've got my neon heart
Shining for you in the dark
A love so bright, it's off the charts
You've got my neon heart
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all starts with you

(Verse 2)
We're walking fast on the wet concrete
The rhythm matches when our eyes meet
Don't need a promise, don't need a vow
My only moment is right here, right now

(Pre-Chorus)
I hear your footsteps in the hall
I'm not afraid to fall
This is the only thing I know is true

(Chorus)
You've got my neon heart
Shining for you in the dark
A love so bright, it's off the charts
You've got my neon heart
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all starts with you

(Bridge)
(Keyboard Solo)
Let the city sleep, we're wide awake
A chance that we're both gonna take!

(Chorus)
You've got my neon heart
Shining for you in the dark
A love so bright, it's off the charts
You've got my neon heart
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all starts with you

(Outro)
My neon heart... (Shining for you)
My neon heart...
(Spoken) Thank you!
