**LORE NOTE:**
"Time is money!" With a strict 30-minute opening slot and a tour manager watching the clock, the band had no time for deep cuts. Apex Records demanded they prioritize their high-energy synth-pop hits to win over the headliner's pop-focused audience. You can hear the urgency in the performance—the tempo is slightly faster than the studio version as they race to fit the setlist into their allotted window.

**LYRICS:**

(Spoken Intro)
I wanna see you dancing to this one, Chicago!

(Verse 1)
The city's quiet, the sun is down
We're in the glow of the other side of town
The beat is calling from a place I know
Just follow the sound, and let it go

(Chorus)
We're dancing in the neon (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're moving 'til the night is gone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Forget about tomorrow
We're shining like a light
Dancing in the neon tonight!

(Verse 2)
The rhythm's heavy, a flashing bright
Reflected colors in your eyes
I don't care what the real world wants
This moment's all that I could ever want

(Chorus)
We're dancing in the neon (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're moving 'til the night is gone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Forget about tomorrow
We're shining like a light
Dancing in the neon tonight!

(Bridge)
Don't stop, don't stop the feeling
This music's got me reeling
Don't stop, don't stop the beat
(Synth-pop breakdown / keyboard solo)

(Chorus)
We're dancing in the neon (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're moving 'til the night is gone (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Forget about tomorrow
We're shining like a light
Dancing in the neon tonight!

(Outro)
Dancing in the neon... (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Til the night is gone...
(Spoken) How you doing out there?!
