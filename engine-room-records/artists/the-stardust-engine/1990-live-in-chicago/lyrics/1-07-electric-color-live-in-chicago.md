**LORE NOTE:**
The Grand Finale. Because The Stardust Engine was the opening act with a strict 30-minute slot, there was no "fake exit" or encore. They had to transition straight from the emotional weight of "My Anchor Holds" directly into this high-energy closer. The performance is frantic and joyful, designed to leave the audience buzzing for the headliner while proving that the "opening act" could steal the show.

**LYRICS:**

(Spoken Intro)
Thank you, Chicago! You've been beautiful!
This is our last song!

(Verse 1)
Woke up this morning, the world was gray
Didn't know the colors had all faded away
Been living in a room with the curtains drawn tight
Then you flipped a switch and turned on the light

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm seeing in electric color
Finding a rhythm I never knew
Dancing in a brand new summer
My whole world feels bright and new
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all started with you!

(Verse 2)
The city sounds were just a buzz in my ear
A static station I could never quite hear
But now the noise is turning into a song
And I finally feel like I belong

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm seeing in electric color
Finding a rhythm I never knew
Dancing in a brand new summer
My whole world feels bright and new
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all started with you!

(Bridge)
The beat is getting stronger
I can't hide it any longer
My heart is playing catch-up
To the music turning way up!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm seeing in electric color
Finding a rhythm I never knew
Dancing in a brand new summer
My whole world feels bright and new
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all started with you!

(Outro)
Electric color
Feeling so new
It's all because of you
(Spoken) Thank you! Goodnight, everybody! We're The Stardust Engine!
