**LORE NOTE:**
The opening statement of the "Freedom Era." Recorded in the warehouse with amps turned to 11, this track acts as a direct rejection of the "hollow sound" Apex forced the band to make for five years. The line "I am the static! I am the noise!" became the rallying cry for the "Ironhead" fanbase during the band's independent rebirth.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
You wanted pop, you wanted clean
A hollow sound from a thin machine
You tried to tune me out, you tried to change the dial
But I've been waiting all this while

(Chorus)
I am the static! I am the noise!
The signal breaking, the hidden voice
I am the static!
The feedback wail!
The story that you tried to derail!

(Verse 2)
This isn't synth-pop, this isn't grace
This is the sound of a different place
This is the heart you tried to hide
The part of us that never died

(Chorus)
I am the static! I am the noise!
The signal breaking, the hidden voice
I am the static!
The feedback wail!
The story that you tried to derail!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
I am the static! I am the noise!
The signal breaking, the hidden voice
I am the static!
The feedback wail!
The story that you tried to derail!

(Outro)
I am the static...
I am the static...
Can you hear me now?
