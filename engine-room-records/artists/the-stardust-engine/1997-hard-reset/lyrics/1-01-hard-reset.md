LORE NOTE:
The opening statement of the "Freedom Era." While The Warehouse Tapes (1995) was a raw "bat signal" to the fans, Hard Reset (1997) was a professional declaration. This track serves as the direct narrative sequel to the 1995 epic Escape Velocity (Ad Astra).

Where Ad Astra ended with the ship clearing the atmosphere, Hard Reset begins with the terrifying silence of space. The main engines have cut out, and the crew realizes they must manually reboot the ship's core to stabilize their orbit. It is a metaphor for the band's own journey: they escaped the gravity of Apex Records, but now they must survive the vacuum of independence.

LYRICS:
[Intro]
(A deep, resonant bass thrum starts the track—like a massive engine idling. A high-pitched telemetry bleep repeats in time. Then, a heavy, driving drum fill kicks in.)

[Verse 1]
The G-force fades, the shaking stops
We're floating past the mountain tops
The old computer's dead and gone
We're running on the break of dawn

[Verse 2]
The screens are black, the air is still
We're drifting on a silent hill
Engage the manual override
There's nowhere left for us to hide

[Verse 3]
They said we'd burn, they said we'd break
That freedom was a huge mistake
But look at how the gauges glow
We're generating our own flow

[Verse 4]
I see the nebula ahead
A path where angels fear to tread
The Stardust isn't just a name
It's fuel for the Engine's flame

[Pre-Chorus]
Thrusters? Ready
Vector? Steady
We have to jump the spark
To light up the dark!

[Chorus]
Hard Reset!
Flip the switch and clear the cache
We’re rising from the static crash
Hard Reset!
The code is new, the core is bright
We’re burning through the edge of night
No ground control!
No gravity!
Just the Engine and the Galaxy!
Hard Reset!

[Bridge]
Stabilizing...
Synchronizing...
The hull is holding
The view is unfolding
SYSTEM... ONLINE!

[Guitar Solo](A soaring, melodic solo that mimics the feeling of zero-gravity flight. Lots of delay and chorus.)

[Chorus]
Hard Reset!
Flip the switch and clear the cache
We’re rising from the static crash
Hard Reset!
The code is new, the core is bright
We’re burning through the edge of night
No backup plan, no turning back
We’re the masters of this track!
HARD! RESET!

[Outro]
We are online
Course laid in
Let's fly
(Final power chord rings out, followed by the hum of a stable engine)
