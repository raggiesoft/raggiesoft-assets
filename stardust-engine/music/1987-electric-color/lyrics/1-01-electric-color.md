**LORE NOTE:**
The solid **#2 hit**. It sat at the runner-up spot for six weeks, famously blocked from #1 by a certain "novelty song" that swept the summer of '87.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
Woke up this morning, the world was gray
Didn't know the colors had all faded away
Been living in a room with the curtains drawn tight
Then you flipped a switch and turned on the light

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm seeing in electric color
Finding a rhythm I never knew
Dancing in a brand new summer
My whole world feels bright and new
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all started with you!

(Verse 2)
The city sounds were just a buzz in my ear
A static station I could never quite hear
But now the noise is turning into a song
And I finally feel like I belong

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm seeing in electric color
Finding a rhythm I never knew
Dancing in a brand new summer
My whole world feels bright and new
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all started with you!

(Bridge)
The beat is getting stronger
I can't hide it any longer
My heart is playing catch-up
To the music turning way up!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
Oh, I'm seeing in electric color
Finding a rhythm I never knew
Dancing in a brand new summer
My whole world feels bright and new
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all started with you!

(Outro)
Electric color
Feeling so new
It's all because of you
