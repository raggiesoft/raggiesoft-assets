**LORE NOTE:**
Ryan's first act of "malicious compliance." He hid angsty, anti-corporate lyrics about "living under a plastic sky" inside a polished, studio-approved pop-rock wrapper. It is a direct protest against the "thin" sound the studio demanded—Ryan sings explicitly about his guitar being "clean" and the drums being "thin" while the executives nodded along, missing the insult completely.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The camera's on, the smile is bright
Another take in the burning light
They painted the set with a perfect blue
But it doesn't feel real, it doesn't feel true

(Chorus)
We're living under a plastic sky (Oh-oh-oh)
They tell me "jump," I ask "how high?"
(Oh-oh-oh)
It's just a set, it's all a lie
Living under a plastic sky

(Verse 2)
My guitar is clean, the drums are thin
They polished away all the grit and sin
I want to scream, I want to roar
But they just ask me to sing some more

(Chorus)
We're living under a plastic sky (Oh-oh-oh)
They tell me "jump," I ask "how high?"
(Oh-oh-oh)
It's just a set, it's all a lie
Living under a plastic sky

(Bridge)
Is this the dream we were chasing?
A different part, a different face
I'm losing me, I'm losing you
In all this shiny, plastic blue

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
We're living under a plastic sky (Oh-oh-oh)
They tell me "jump," I ask "how high?"
(Oh-oh-oh)
It's just a set, it's all a lie
Living under a plastic sky

(Outro)
Plastic sky...
Feeling so new...
(fades out)
