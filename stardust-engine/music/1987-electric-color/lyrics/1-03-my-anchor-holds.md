**LORE NOTE:**
A power ballad the studio marketed as a romance, but which the band wrote about their family bond. This "sibling-love-disguised-as-romance" became a staple of their early sound.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The lights are bright, but the room is cold
Another story that's bought and sold
I'm trying to find a reason why
Beneath this plastic, empty sky

(Chorus)
But when the world is spinning out of my control
You're the one true thing that I can hold
Through the static and the driving rain
You're the one who keeps me sane
You are the shelter, you are the truth
My anchor in this crazy youth

(Verse 2)
They pull us under, they push us high
They build us up just to watch us die
It's hard to know who you can trust
When all the promises turn to dust

(Chorus)
But when the world is spinning out of my control
You're the one true thing that I can hold
Through the static and the driving rain
You're the one who keeps me sane
You are the shelter, you are the truth
My anchor in this crazy youth

(Guitar Solo)

(Bridge)
So let them talk, let them stare
As long as you are standing there
I'm not afraid of what's to come
I know where I belong...

(Chorus)
'Cause when the world is spinning out of my control
You're the one true thing that I can hold
Through the static and the driving rain
You're the one who keeps me sane
You are the shelter, you are the truth
My anchor in this crazy youth

(Outro)
My anchor...
My anchor holds...
(Fades out with piano and synth)
