**LORE NOTE:**
Cassidy's quiet rebellion. Apex executives dismissed this moody, introspective track as "filler," but it became a grassroots anthem for female fans. The honest lyrics about her treatment in the industry ("They tell me 'sing the high note' / They tell me 'wear the red dress'") resonated deeply with young women who felt similarly boxed in by expectations.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
They tell me "sing the high note"
They tell me "wear the red dress"
They never ask me what I wrote
They only want to see the press

(Verse 2)
I bring my chords, my melody
They pat my head and disagree
They turn to him, "now *that's* a sound"
And I'm just standing in the background

(Chorus)
Am I ever gonna break through?
Am I ever gonna get my due?
Or am I just a girl in the band?
A pretty picture, holding your hand

(Verse 3)
They say "be 'Stardust', be the grace"
"Know your role and keep your place"
But I am more than what you see
I'm fighting just to be... me

(Chorus)
Am I ever gonna break through?
Am I ever gonna get my due?
Or am I just a girl in the band?
A pretty picture, holding your hand

(Bridge)
But the music's in my blood
The synth, the key, the flood
You can't erase the fire
My voice is getting higher

(Chorus)
Am I ever gonna break through?
Am I ever gonna get my due?
Or am I just a girl in the band?
A pretty picture, holding your hand

(Outro)
Just a girl...
Just a girl...
(fades out on a shimmering synth pad)
