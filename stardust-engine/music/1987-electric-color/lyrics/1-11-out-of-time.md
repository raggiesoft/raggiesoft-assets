**LORE NOTE:**
Ryan's punk-inspired vent. The 13-track album was too long for a standard vinyl LP, so Apex executives "gleefully" cut this short, 1:35 track from the original vinyl release to save space. They viewed it as "noise," but to Ryan, cutting his rawest song was a direct attempt to silence the "Engine."

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
Tick-tock goes the plastic clock
Another meeting on another block
They're selling me a future that I don't want
It's just the same old tired font

(Chorus)
I'm out of patience!
I'm out of time!
This ain't your product, this life is mine!
Out of patience!
Out of time!
Gonna break free, gonna cross the line!

(Verse 2)
You want another ballad, soft and slow
Another song for the radio
But I've got a fire burning in my hands
You'll never, ever understand

(Chorus)
I'm out of patience!
I'm out of time!
This ain't your product, this life is mine!
Out of patience!
Out of time!
Gonna break free, gonna cross the line!

(Guitar Solo)
(Short, fast, and chaotic. Pure punk-rock energy)

(Chorus)
I'm out of patience!
I'm out of time!
This ain't your product, this life is mine!
Out of patience!
Out of time!
Gonna break free, gonna cross the line!

(Outro)
Out of time!
(Song ends abruptly on a final, crashing chord)
