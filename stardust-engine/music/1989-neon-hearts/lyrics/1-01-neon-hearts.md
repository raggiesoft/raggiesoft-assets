**LORE NOTE:**
The "safe" title track. Apex forced the band to include a callback lyric to their first hit ("It's an electric-colored feeling") to ensure brand consistency. The studio demanded this track open the album to assure fans that the "Stardust" sound hadn't changed, despite the band's desire to move toward rock.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The city's humming, the lights are low
I'm waiting for you, I'm ready to go
The rain is tapping on the glass
I knew this feeling was built to last

(Pre-Chorus)
I hear your footsteps in the hall
I'm not afraid to fall
This is the only thing I know is true

(Chorus)
You've got my neon heart
Shining for you in the dark
A love so bright, it's off the charts
You've got my neon heart
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all starts with you

(Verse 2)
We're walking fast on the wet concrete
The rhythm matches when our eyes meet
Don't need a promise, don't need a vow
My only moment is right here, right now

(Pre-Chorus)
I hear your footsteps in the hall
I'm not afraid to fall
This is the only thing I know is true

(Chorus)
You've got my neon heart
Shining for you in the dark
A love so bright, it's off the charts
You've got my neon heart
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all starts with you

(Bridge)
(A bright, energetic keyboard solo)
Let the city sleep, we're wide awake
A chance that we're both gonna take!

(Chorus)
You've got my neon heart
Shining for you in the dark
A love so bright, it's off the charts
You've got my neon heart
It's an electric-colored feeling
And it all starts with you

(Outro)
My neon heart... (Shining for you)
My neon heart...
(fades out)
