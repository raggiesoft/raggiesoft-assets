**LORE NOTE:**
Ryan's act of "malicious compliance." He delivered the requested synth-pop sound but made the track **5:31 long**—knowing it was too long for radio—and included the protest line, "They're all afraid of the burning cross" (a reference to the canceled "Promise" single). [cite_start]It stands as a middle finger to the studio's "safe" direction[cite: 346, 347].

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The red light's on, the tape is rolling
They're telling me what words to say
I'm trying to find the man I was
But he gets farther every day

(Verse 2)
They want the polish, they want the gleam
The "safer" version of the dream
But all I hear is a thin machine
Another part of their big scene

(Chorus)
It's just a hollow sound
My voice is in the mix
But the words are not my own
It's just a hollow sound
Another plastic fix
I'm singing all alone

(Verse 3)
They're all afraid of the burning cross
Terrified of what they lost
So now they're sanding off the edge
Pushing me back from the ledge

(Chorus)
It's just a hollow sound
My voice is in the mix
But the words are not my own
It's just a hollow sound
Another plastic fix
I'm singing all alone

(Bridge)
(A very clean, melodic, studio-approved keyboard solo)

(Chorus)
It's just a hollow sound
My voice is in the mix
But the words are not my own
It's just a hollow sound
Another plastic fix
I'm singing all alone

(Outro)
A hollow sound...
Just a hollow sound...
(fades)
