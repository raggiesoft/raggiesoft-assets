**LORE NOTE:**
Cassidy's "fierce side" finally breaking through. Following immediately after "Chain Reaction," this arena rock anthem completes the "Side B Rebellion." In it, Cassidy directly rejects the "Stardust" persona Apex forced upon her. While the studio tried to suppress her "Engine" side, this track became the definitive proof that she could rock just as hard as her brother.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
You put me in a box, you told me to be sweet
The "Stardust" girl, the perfect beat
You told me "soften up," you told me "know your place"
But you never saw the fire in my face

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm not your doll!
I'm not your pretty toy
I'm not just a picture for a poster boy
I'm not your doll!
I'm here to make a choice
And I'm gonna make you hear my voice!

(Verse 2)
You're scared of the noise, you're scared of the grit
You're terrified that I'm not gonna fit
In the tiny world you built for me
But I'm about to set myself free

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm not your doll!
I'm not your pretty toy
I'm not just a picture for a poster boy
I'm not your doll!
I'm here to make a choice
And I'm gonna make you hear my voice!

(Guitar Solo)

(Bridge)
You heard the "story to be told"?
Well, I'm the one who'll break the mold!
You wanted 'Stardust'? You get the fire!
My voice is real, and it's getting higher!

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm not your doll!
I'm not your pretty toy
I'm not just a picture for a poster boy
I'm not your doll!
I'm here to make a choice
And I'm gonna make you hear my voice!

(Outro)
Not your doll!
Hear my voice!
(fades out on a wailing guitar note)
