**LORE NOTE:**
The "Punishment" begins. After the explosive rock energy of the "one-two punch" on Side B, Apex executives stepped in to "shut the Engine down." They forced Ryan to record this quiet, introspective ballad to kill the momentum. The lyrics are a meta-commentary on his silencing ("This is the price for being loud / Getting lost back in the crowd").

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The "story" has been told
The echo's fading fast
I tried to "break the mold"
They told me it would never last
They're shutting down the "Engine"

(Chorus)
Now it's quiet on the set (Oh-oh)
Back to the silence and regret
This is the price for being loud
Getting lost back in the crowd
After the laughter...

(Verse 2)
The "noise" we made was all too real
They're terrified of what they feel
So turn the keyboards up again
And hide the anger and the pain

(Chorus)
Now it's quiet on the set (Oh-oh)
Back to the silence and regret
This is the price for being loud
Getting lost back in the crowd
After the laughter...

(Bridge)
(A soft, melodic keyboard solo. No guitars.)
They want the "Stardust," safe and light
Just close your eyes and end the fight
Just close your eyes...

(Chorus)
Now it's quiet on the set (Oh-oh)
Back to the silence and regret
This is the price for being loud
Getting lost back in the crowd
After the laughter...

(Outro)
After the laughter...
Just... quiet...
