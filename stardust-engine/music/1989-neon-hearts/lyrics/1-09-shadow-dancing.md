**LORE NOTE:**
The studio strikes back. Immediately following the "rebellion" of Side B's opening tracks, Apex Records moved to crush the momentum. They forced Cassidy back into her "Stardust" persona for this moody, atmospheric synth track, explicitly banning electric guitars from the mix to ensure the album returned to a "safe, marketable" sound before the end.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The city lights are cold tonight
I'm walking under the pale moonlight
I see two people passing by
Reflected in a stranger's eye

(Chorus)
We're just shadow dancing
A pantomime, a game of chance
Trying to make it look like romance
We're just shadow dancing
Afraid to stop, afraid to fall
Just shadows on the wall

(Verse 2)
You say the words I want to hear
You whisper "love" to hide the fear
We're both performing in this play
Hoping the night will turn to day

(Chorus)
We're just shadow dancing
A pantomime, a game of chance
Trying to make it look like romance
We're just shadow dancing
Afraid to stop, afraid to fall
Just shadows on the wall

(Bridge)
(A moody, atmospheric keyboard solo)
Is this real? I'll never know
Just follow where the music goes
Just keep on dancing...

(Chorus)
We're just shadow dancing
A pantomime, a game of chance
Trying to make it look like romance
We're just shadow dancing
Afraid to stop, afraid to fall
Just shadows on the wall

(Outro)
Shadows on the wall...
Shadow dancing...
