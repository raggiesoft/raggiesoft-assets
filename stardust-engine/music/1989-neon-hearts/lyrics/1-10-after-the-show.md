**LORE NOTE:**
Ryan's final laugh. As "punishment" for the heavy rock tracks earlier on Side B, Apex ordered him to close the album with a quiet ballad, explicitly forbidding "pounding drums" on the track sheet. [cite_start]Ryan complied by recording the song using **percussive acoustic guitar**—slapping the body of the instrument to simulate a beat[cite: 353]. It was a subtle, rhythmic "middle finger" to the executives who tried to silence the "Engine."

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The stage is empty, the crowd is gone
Another night, another dawn
We played the part, we sang the song
And now we have to move along

(Verse 2)
The neon heart is turning low
It's just a faded, distant glow
Is this the dream we wanted so?
I guess we'll never know

(Chorus)
We're just echoes in the city
It's not so bad, it's not so pretty
Just echoes, turning to gray
We'll come back and fight another day

(Bridge)
(A soft, melodic acoustic guitar solo, underscored by the rhythmic slapping of the guitar body)
Another day...
Another way...

(Chorus)
We're just echoes in the city
It's not so bad, it's not so pretty
Just echoes, turning to gray
We'll come back and fight another day

(Outro)
After the show...
Goodnight...
(fades out on acoustic guitar)
