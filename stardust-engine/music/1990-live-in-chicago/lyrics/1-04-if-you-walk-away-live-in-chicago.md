**LORE NOTE:**
For Cassidy, who is autistic, the lyrics of this song were not a performance—they were a terrifying "what-if" scenario that she experienced viscerally every time she sang it. While the studio marketed it as a romantic breakup ballad, Cassidy sang it as a desperate plea to her brother. The fear in her voice on this recording is real.

Ryan, who is also autistic, understood her need for absolute certainty better than anyone. He famously had to reassure her after *every single concert*—often using the exact same phrase, "Family sticks together"—to ground her back in reality and confirm that he was never going to leave her.

**LYRICS:**

(Spoken Intro)
Thank you. We're gonna slow things down for you for just a minute...

(Verse 1)
The streetlights make a blurry line
I'm running through the same old signs
I'm just a face in a passing crowd
Afraid to speak my thoughts out loud

(Verse 2)
But then you found me in the noise
You heard a whisper in my voice
You gave me something to believe
A reason I would never leave

(Chorus)
If you walked away
The sky would lose its blue
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost in the gray
If you walked away
My world would fall apart
You're the owner of my (Neon) heart

(Verse 3)
They build these walls so high and steep
With promises they never keep
But we have a fortress, strong and true
I'm safe as long as I have you

(Chorus)
If you walked away
The sky would lose its blue
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost in the gray
If you walked away
My world would fall apart
You're the owner of my (Neon) heart

(Bridge)
(A very safe, melodic, clean keyboard solo)
I'm holding on, I'm holding tight
Don't let me go into the night...

(Chorus)
If you walked away
The sky would lose its blue
I wouldn't know what to do
I'd be lost in the gray
If you walked away
My world would fall apart
You're the owner of my (Neon) heart

(Outro)
Don't walk away...
(Spoken) Thank you so much.
