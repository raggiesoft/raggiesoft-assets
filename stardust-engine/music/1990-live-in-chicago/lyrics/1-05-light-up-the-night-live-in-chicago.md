**LORE NOTE:**
The "Big Bet." Apex Records had poured their entire marketing budget into this track, convinced it was the #1 hit that would define the album. Consequently, the band was under immense pressure to deliver a "perfect," high-energy performance of it every night. You can hear the professional polish here—Cassidy hits every note and Ryan plays the "good soldier," executing the catchy hooks exactly as the studio demanded, proving they could play the game even if they hated the rules.

**LYRICS:**

(Spoken Intro)
Are you ready to light up the night, Chicago?!

(Verse 1)
I was walking in the shadows
I was living in the gray
Waiting for a signal
To help me find my way

(Pre-Chorus)
I can feel a new connection
Like a spark inside the dark
You're my one true direction
You're the fire, you're the spark

(Chorus)
We're gonna light up the night! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Chasing the stars 'til the morning light
We're gonna make it all right (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Turning our color on, shining so bright
We're gonna light up the night!

(Verse 2)
This city sleeps, but we're awake
A promise that we'll never break
The future's ours, I see the sign
Just put your hand in mine

(Pre-Chorus)
I can feel a new connection
Like a spark inside the dark
You're my one true direction
You're the fire, you're the spark

(Chorus)
We're gonna light up the night! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Chasing the stars 'til the morning light
We're gonna make it all right (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Turning our color on, shining so bright
We're gonna light up the night!

(Bridge)
No more shadows, no more gray
(Keyboard Solo)
Let's light it up!

(Chorus)
We're gonna light up the night! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Chasing the stars 'til the morning light
We're gonna make it all right (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Turning our color on, shining so bright
We're gonna light up the night!

(Outro)
Light up the night... (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Shining so bright...
(Spoken) We love you!
