**LORE NOTE:**
A love letter between siblings disguised as a power ballad. While Apex Records marketed this as a romantic duet to sell records, the "Ironheads" in the audience knew the truth. When Ryan and Cassidy sang this to each other on stage, it wasn't about romance; it was about survival. It was their public promise that no matter what the studio threw at them, they would be each other's anchor in the storm.

**LYRICS:**

(Spoken Intro)
This is a song for that one person who keeps you sane... the one who's your anchor.

(Verse 1)
The lights are bright, but the room is cold
Another story that's bought and sold
I'm trying to find a reason why
Beneath this plastic, empty sky

(Chorus)
But when the world is spinning out of my control
You're the one true thing that I can hold
Through the static and the driving rain
You're the one who keeps me sane
You are the shelter, you are the truth
My anchor in this crazy youth

(Verse 2)
They pull us under, they push us high
They build us up just to watch us die
It's hard to know who you can trust
When all the promises turn to dust

(Chorus)
But when the world is spinning out of my control
You're the one true thing that I can hold
Through the static and the driving rain
You're the one who keeps me sane
You are the shelter, you are the truth
My anchor in this crazy youth

(Guitar Solo)
(A soaring, melodic solo that Ryan plays while standing back-to-back with Cassidy at the piano)

(Bridge)
So let them talk, let them stare
As long as you are standing there
I'm not afraid of what's to come
I know where I belong...

(Chorus)
'Cause when the world is spinning out of my control
You're the one true thing that I can hold
Through the static and the driving rain
You're the one who keeps me sane
You are the shelter, you are the truth
My anchor in this crazy youth

(Outro)
My anchor...
My anchor holds...
(Spoken) We love you, Chicago!
