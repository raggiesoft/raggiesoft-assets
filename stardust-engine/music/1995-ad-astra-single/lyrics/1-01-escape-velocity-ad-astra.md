**LORE NOTE:**
The "Magnum Opus." Originally released as the B-Side of *The Warehouse Tapes*, this suite stands here as the monumental A-Side it was always meant to be.

This 15-minute progressive rock journey is Cassidy O'Connell's autobiography in four movements, charting her escape from the trauma of the 'Friction' trial ("The Cage") to the transcendence of total artistic freedom ("The Cosmos").

Known by fans simply as **"Ad Astra,"** the track features a distinct "mechanical cutoff" sound between Part II and Part III. This wasn't a studio effect; Ryan O'Connell physically pulled the plug on his guitar amplifier mid-recording to simulate the violent silence of a rocket's Main Engine Cutoff (MECO).

In the band's "Ironworks" canon, this track acts as a coded transmission broadcast from Port Telsus, sending safe navigational coordinates to resistance fighters hidden in The Weave.

**LYRICS:**

[Part I: The Cage]
(Whispered, over a dark, shimmering synth pad)
The walls are cold, the air is thin
The noise outside is closing in
A single light, a buzzing sound
Another day in the underground

I'm running from the face I see
The "victim-saint" they made of me
The "wholesome girl," so sad and worn
A "David" for their Goliath's scorn

This rage is just a heavy stone
A gravity I've outgrown
Shedding skin, shedding weight
Escaping from this world of hate

They loved the trial, the "family" torn
They loved the story, a new star born
But not from music, not from grace
From the "hot-chocolate-drinking" "angel face"

The "Shark" was right, the "nuke" went off
We won the battle, but at what cost?
We're "radioactive," we're "litigious"
We're just the joke, the "victim-saints"

(Slightly louder)
I'm trapped inside this "Wilderness"
This "Fortress" built on bitterness
This isn't freedom, this is a cell
This "righteous hell"...
This "righteous hell"...

[Part II: Ignition (Ad Astra)]
(The dark synth pad is suddenly cut by a rapid, driving analog synth sequencer. A pounding, 80s acoustic drum beat kicks in, locked with a driving bassline. Vocals become strong, clear, and melodic.)

I see a signal in the endless black
A single light, no turning back
The pull of the old world fades away
A new horizon, a new day

The countdown's running in my head
Ignoring all the things they said
The "Engine" roars, a crimson light
A pillar of fire in the night

The pressure builds, I'm pinned to the seat
My heart is pounding with the beat
The G-force pulling, a heavy stone
The last chain breaks, I'm not alone

(Chorus)
I'm climbing! Climbing!
Past the point of no return
I'm flying! Flying!
With a fire I let burn
Just a signal, a distant light
Burning through the endless night
Ad astra... (To the stars!)
Ad astra!

(Instrumental Break)
(A short, fast, synthesizer and guitar riff-heavy section. Pure 80s prog-rock energy.)

The sky is tearing at the seams
Awake now from their broken dreams
The "Stardust" is just a trail of dust
The "Stardust" is the thing I trust

The clouds are falling far below
A place of pain I used to know
The blue gives way to endless black
There is no thought of turning back

(Chorus)
I'm climbing! Climbing!
Past the point of no return
I'm flying! Flying!
With a fire I let burn
Just a signal, a distant light
Burning through the endless night
Ad astra... (To the stars!)
Ad astra!

[Part III: The Cosmos]
(The driving beat cuts off abruptly. Tempo slows to a crawl. Vast, sweeping synth pads take over.)

I'm floating now, the engine's off
The silence is a holy sound
The rage is gone, the fear is lost
In this new universe I've found

The "Cage" is just a distant star
A tiny light I left behind
I finally know just who you are
The other half of my own mind

(Ethereal, layered vocals swell)
I'm loved by the sun
I'm held by the void
An orbit just begun
A life not destroyed

I'm loved by the moon
I'm cradled by the black
My heart is back in tune
There is no turning back

And the stars are singing
A song I understand
I'm finally, finally
Reaching for your hand

(Instrumental Bridge)
(Music swells. A long, beautiful, melodic, and highly emotional electric guitar solo. Full of hope, not rage.)

(Ethereal, layered vocals return)
I see the colors of the nebula
A place I've only seen in dreams
The reds, the blues, the purples call
Flowing in majestic streams

This is the place I was meant to be
This is the "Stardust" that is me
The cosmos and the rocket's fire
My one, my only true desire

(Ethereal, layered vocals)
I'm loved by the sun
I'm held by the void
An orbit just begun
A life not destroyed

And the stars are singing
A song I understand
I'm finally, finally
Reaching for your hand

[Part IV: Re-entry (The New World)]
(Music slowly fades back to just the shimmering synth pads and ethereal, whispered vocals)

The walls are gone
The air is clear
There is no noise
There is no fear

The "Stardust" is a forgotten ghost
The "Engine" has delivered me to the coast
Of a new world, a new shore
A place I've never been before

The "Cage" is broken, the "Victim-Saint" is dead
A new, clean script is in my head
The "Friction" burned away in the fire
Leaving only my true desire

(Ethereal, layered vocals swell for the finale)
I'm loved by the sun...
I'm held by the void...
My orbit has begun...
My life is not destroyed...

Ad astra...
Ad astra...
(To the stars...)

(Song fades out on a final, sustained, peaceful synthesizer chord)
