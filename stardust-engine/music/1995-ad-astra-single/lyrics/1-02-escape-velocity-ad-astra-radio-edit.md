**LORE NOTE:**
The "Trojan Horse" edit. Knowing that mainstream radio would never play a 15-minute prog-rock suite, the band (at Holly's insistence) cut this condensed 5-minute version for the promo CD.

It strips away the extended ambient transitions and long instrumental solos, focusing purely on the core narrative arc from "The Cage" to "Re-entry." While die-hard "Ironheads" consider it incomplete, this is the version that actually charted, introducing millions of new fans to the band's "Freedom Era" sound.

**LYRICS:**

[Part I: The Cage]
(Whispered, over a dark, shimmering synth pad)
The walls are cold, the air is thin
The noise outside is closing in
I'm running from the face I see
The "victim-saint" they made of me
This rage is just a heavy stone
A gravity I've outgrown
Shedding skin, shedding weight
Escaping from this world of hate

[Part II: Ignition (Ad Astra)]
(A driving, 80s analog synth sequencer starts, bass and drums kick in)
(Vocals become strong and melodic)
I see a light in the endless black
A signal calling, no turning back
The pull of the old world fades away
A new horizon, a new day

(Chorus)
(Full band, soaring ethereal vocals)
I'm climbing, climbing
Past the point of no return
I'm flying, flying
With a fire I let burn
Just a signal, a distant light
Burning through the endless night
Ad astra... (To the stars!)

[Part III: The Cosmos (Loved by the Sun)]
(Music becomes vast, atmospheric, and beautiful. Grand, sweeping synth pads and melodic guitar)
I'm floating now, the engine's off
The silence is a holy sound
The rage is gone, the fear is lost
In this new universe I've found

I'm loved by the sun
I'm held by the void
An orbit just begun
A life not destroyed
And the stars are singing
A song I understand
I'm finally, finally
Reaching for your hand

(Instrumental Bridge)
(A long, melodic, soaring electric guitar solo, full of emotion and hope)

[Part IV: Re-entry (The New World)]
(Music slowly fades back to just the shimmering synth pads and ethereal, whispered vocals)
The walls are gone
The air is clear
There is no noise
There is no fear
Ad astra...
Ad astra...
(fades out)
