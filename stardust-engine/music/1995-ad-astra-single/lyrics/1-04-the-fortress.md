**LORE NOTE:**
The epic closer of Side A. This arena-rock anthem is dedicated to the "Ironheads" and CPI alumni who funded the band's freedom through the "Forger Nation War Chest." The "Fortress" is both their warehouse studio and the protective wall their fans built around them.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
The world was burning, the lies were loud
We were the joke in the tabloid crowd
We had no shelter, we had no home
Just the open road, and a telephone

(Chorus)
But you, you built a fortress
You gave us walls when we were torn
You built a place to hide from the storm
You are the "Ironheads"!
You are the shield!
The only army that would not yield!
This is our fortress!

(Verse 2)
This isn't L.A., this isn't a dream
This is a warehouse, this is a scream
We're building our truth, we're building our sound
Right here on our hallowed ground

(Chorus)
'Cause you, you built a fortress
You gave us walls when we were torn
You built a place to hide from the storm
You are the "Ironheads"!
You are the shield!
The only army that would not yield!
This is our fortress!

(Guitar Solo)

(Outro)
Our fortress...
Our home...
We are the Forgers!
(fades out)
