**LORE NOTE:**
Ryan's raw, "jangle-rock" rage track. It retells the infamous "dirty mirror" incident from the 1992 *Friction* photo shoot, where an executive tried to offer him cocaine on a mirror, and Ryan—innocently thinking it was dirt—wiped it clean with a napkin. The song channels his fury at the executive who humiliated him and tried to destroy his family.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
You brought your tray, your silver plate
You thought you'd open up the gate
You showed me powder on a glass
You thought you had a man of class

(Chorus)
It was just dust! It was just a lie!
So I wiped it clean, and I watched you die
You called it 'art', you called it 'style'
It was just garbage in a filthy pile!

(Verse 2)
You held your clipboard like a gun
You thought the battle was already won
You crossed the line, you showed your hand
You'll never, ever understand

(Chorus)
It was just dust! It was just a lie!
So I wiped it clean, and I watched you die
You called it 'art', you called it 'style'
It was just garbage in a filthy pile!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
It was just dust! It was just a lie!
So I wiped it clean, and I watched you die
You called it 'art', 'cuz you're a fake
It was just garbage, make no mistake!
