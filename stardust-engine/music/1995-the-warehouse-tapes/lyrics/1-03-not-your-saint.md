**LORE NOTE:**
After the "Tabloid Hell" of the 1994 trial, the media tried to paint Cassidy as a "Victim-Saint"—a fragile, broken doll. This fierce arena anthem is her rejection of that narrative. She is neither the "Stardust" pop star nor the "Victim" of the scandal; she is a rock musician standing on her own two feet.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
You put my name in flashing lights
You loved the story, you loved the fight
You called me 'pure', you called me 'clean'
Another part of your sick scene

(Chorus)
I am not your victim
I am not your saint
I'm the monster that you tried to paint
I am not your 'Stardust'
I am not your grace
I'm the one who's spitting in your face

(Verse 2)
You loved the trial, the 'family' torn
The 'wholesome' girl, so sad and worn
You never stopped to ask me
What I was fighting just to be

(Chorus)
I am not your victim
I am not your saint
I'm the monster that you tried to paint
I am not your 'Stardust'
I am not your grace
I'm the one who's spitting in your face

(Bridge)
I'm not a victim...
I'm not a saint...
I am a weapon!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
I am not your victim
I am not your saint
I'm the monster that you tried to paint
I am not your 'Stardust'
I am not your grace
I'm the one who's spitting in your face
