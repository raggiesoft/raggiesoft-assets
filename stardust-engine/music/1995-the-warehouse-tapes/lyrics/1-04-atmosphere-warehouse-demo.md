**LORE NOTE:**
The "Lost Gem" from the canceled 1992 *Friction* sessions. The band wrote this song about the literal, scientific friction of a space shuttle re-entering Earth's atmosphere ("Here comes the friction / Feel the fire"). The "rogue" executive, Julian Vance, misinterpreted these lyrics as sexual metaphors, leading to the catastrophic misunderstanding that destroyed the contract. This is the original 1992 demo, released here for the first time.

**LYRICS:**

(Verse 1)
Black velvet, a million lights
Floating silent through the endless night
The world below, a sleeping blue
I'm holding my breath, I'm thinking of you

(Verse 2)
The signal's given, the turn is made
The point of no return, the price is paid
The fragile hull begins to shake
A promise that we're bound to make

(Chorus)
Here comes the friction, feel the fire
Burning up with our desire
A sheet of flame, a crimson glow
The only way we know to go
We're coming home, we're breaking through
This atmosphere... with you

(Verse 3)
The pressure builds, the gauges scream
This is the violence of the dream
A single tear in the metal skin
Is all it takes to let the outside in

(Chorus)
Here comes the friction, feel the fire
Burning up with our desire
A sheet of flame, a crimson glow
The only way we know to go
We're coming home, we're breaking through
This atmosphere... with you

(Bridge)
We're losing control, the edges blur
A terror and a beauty...
Burning up!

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)
Here comes the friction, feel the fire
Burning up with our desire
A sheet of flame, a crimson glow
The only way we know to go
We're coming home, we're breaking through
This atmosphere... with you

(Outro)
Burning up...
Friction...
Coming home...
